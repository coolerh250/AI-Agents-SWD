# AI Agents Team Work — API Blueprint (Step 66A.3)

> **Blueprint / scope only. Proposed API — NOT implemented. No endpoint built, no runtime change, no
> external action, no production action.**

Each endpoint: purpose · required role · request/response summary · audit event · risk · stage.

| Endpoint | Purpose | Required role | Req / Resp summary | Audit event | Risk | Stage |

| `POST /operator/dlq-retry/{id}/replay` | manual replay (D13) | **Admin/Agent-Op only** | — → {replayed} | dlq.replayed | **high** | 66D/66G |

## Cross-cutting

- All mutating endpoints are role-checked server-side (rbac blueprint) and emit audit events.
- Replay (D13) and Re-run-QA limit (D12) enforced at the endpoint.
- Existing read-only `/operations/*` reused where possible; no endpoint performs production effect
  (`production_executed_true_count=0`).
- `web-research-sources` endpoints are design-only; the connector is future work.

## 66B.1 implementation status (2026-07-09)

`POST /tasks`, `GET /tasks`, `GET /tasks/{id}`, `POST /tasks/{id}/submit` are **implemented and
deployed** on the test runtime (`apps/orchestrator/src/task_api.py`), matching the paths specified
above exactly (the deliberate `/tasks` vs. `/operations/*` deviation noted in the original blueprint).
Auth is a fail-closed test-only header simulation (`TASK_API_TEST_AUTH_ENABLED` +
`X-Task-Actor`/`X-Task-Role`), not a real session — documented gap, see
`step66b1-known-gaps.md`. All other endpoints in the table above remain design-only, staged for
66C–66G.

## Step 66B.3 hardening status (2026-07-09)

`GET /tasks/{id}` now also returns `dispatch_enabled: false` (previously only `POST /tasks` and
`POST /tasks/{id}/submit` did). Every RBAC denial (403) across all four endpoints now emits a
`task_rbac_denied` audit event in addition to the existing `task_created` / `task_submitted` /
`task_rejected_by_policy` events. Fail-closed auth errors are now three distinct codes
(`missing_actor` / `missing_role` / `invalid_role`) instead of two. No endpoint's request/response
shape or required role changed otherwise. See `step66b3-rbac-audit-safety-hardening-report.md`.

## Step 66C.1 implementation status (2026-07-10)

`GET /tasks/{id}/workroom`, `POST /tasks/{id}/workroom/messages`, `POST /tasks/{id}/clarifications`,
and `POST /tasks/{id}/clarifications/{id}/answer` are **implemented and deployed** on the test
runtime (`apps/orchestrator/src/workroom_api.py`), replacing the originally proposed
`GET/POST .../workroom/messages` clarification-answer path
(`POST /tasks/{id}/clarifications/{cid}/answer`) with the exact path above — a minor path
refinement, not a behavior change. Auth is the same fail-closed test-only header simulation reused
from 66B.1/66B.3 (no new auth mechanism). All four responses state `dispatch_enabled: false`; the
three mutating endpoints also state `resume_dispatch_enabled: false`. `GET /deliveries` and
everything below it in the table above remain design-only, staged for 66D–66G. See
`step66c1-workroom-clarification-api-foundation-report.md`.

## Step 66C.3 implementation status (2026-07-11)

A new endpoint, not in the original blueprint table above, is **implemented and deployed**:
`GET /tasks/{id}/audit-evidence` (task-scoped audit evidence, safe metadata only — allowlisted
fields, never a raw message/answer body). Required role:
Platform Admin/Agent Operator/Security-Compliance Reviewer/PM-Engineering Lead (Requester and
Reviewer/Approver denied by default). Response: `— → {task_id, events:[{audit_event_id, event_type,
actor, role, action, status, message_id, clarification_id, message_type, visibility, body_length,
body_hash, created_at}], dispatch_enabled:false, resume_dispatch_enabled:false}`. Audit event on
denial: `audit_evidence_rbac_denied`. Risk: low (read-only, allowlist-projected). Stage: 66C.
`GET /tasks/{id}/workroom` now also applies server-side message-visibility filtering by role (no
request/response shape change, fewer messages returned for restricted roles). See
`step66c3-workroom-audit-visibility-hardening-report.md`.
