# AI Agents Team Work — API Blueprint (Step 66A.3)

> **Blueprint / scope only. Proposed API — NOT implemented. No endpoint built, no runtime change, no
> external action, no production action.**

Each endpoint: purpose · required role · request/response summary · audit event · risk · stage.

| `POST /tasks/{id}/workroom/messages` | post message | participant (RBAC by type) | {type,body} → {message_id,correlation_id} | workroom.message_posted | low | 66C |
| `GET /deliveries` | delivery inbox | PM/Lead/Reviewer | — → [delivery] | delivery.viewed | low | 66D |

| `POST /deliveries/{id}/rerun-qa` | re-run QA (≤3) | PM/Lead/Reviewer | — → {state:qa_rerun,seq} | delivery.qa_rerun | med | 66D |
| `POST /deliveries/{id}/escalate` | escalate | any review role | {reason} → {state:escalated} | delivery.escalated | med | 66D |
| `GET /operator/actions` | action-center queues | Admin/Agent-Op/Reviewer | — → {queues} | operator.viewed | low | 66G |
| `GET /operator/approvals` | pending approvals | Reviewer/Approver/Admin | — → [approval] | approval.viewed | med | 66D/66G |

| `GET /operator/dlq-retry` | DLQ/retry queue | Admin/Agent-Op | — → [dlq_entry] | dlq.viewed | high | 66D/66G |
| `POST /operator/dlq-retry/{id}/replay` | manual replay (D13) | **Admin/Agent-Op only** | — → {replayed} | dlq.replayed | **high** | 66D/66G |
| `GET /notifications` | notification feed | any (own) | — → [notification] | notification.viewed | low | 66G |
| `GET /settings/web-research-sources` | list whitelist | Admin/Sec review | — → [source] | source.viewed | low | future |

## Cross-cutting

- All mutating endpoints are role-checked server-side (rbac blueprint) and emit audit events.
- Replay (D13) and Re-run-QA limit (D12) enforced at the endpoint.
- Existing read-only `/operations/*` reused where possible; no endpoint performs production effect
  (`production_executed_true_count=0`).
- `web-research-sources` endpoints are design-only; the connector is future work.

## 66B.1 implementation status (2026-07-09)

`POST /tasks`, `GET /tasks`, `GET /tasks/{id}`, `POST /tasks/{id}/submit` are **implemented and
deployed** on the test runtime (`apps/orchestrator/src/task_api.py`), matching the paths specified
above exactly (the deliberate `/tasks` vs. `/operations/*` deviation noted in the original blueprint).
Auth is a fail-closed test-only header simulation (`TASK_API_TEST_AUTH_ENABLED` +
`X-Task-Actor`/`X-Task-Role`), not a real session — documented gap, see
`step66b1-known-gaps.md`. All other endpoints in the table above remain design-only, staged for
66C–66G.

## Step 66B.3 hardening status (2026-07-09)

`GET /tasks/{id}` now also returns `dispatch_enabled: false` (previously only `POST /tasks` and
`POST /tasks/{id}/submit` did). Every RBAC denial (403) across all four endpoints now emits a
`task_rbac_denied` audit event in addition to the existing `task_created` / `task_submitted` /
`task_rejected_by_policy` events. Fail-closed auth errors are now three distinct codes
(`missing_actor` / `missing_role` / `invalid_role`) instead of two. No endpoint's request/response
shape or required role changed otherwise. See `step66b3-rbac-audit-safety-hardening-report.md`.

## Step 66C.1 implementation status (2026-07-10)

`GET /tasks/{id}/workroom`, `POST /tasks/{id}/workroom/messages`, `POST /tasks/{id}/clarifications`,
and `POST /tasks/{id}/clarifications/{id}/answer` are **implemented and deployed** on the test
runtime (`apps/orchestrator/src/workroom_api.py`), replacing the originally proposed
`GET/POST .../workroom/messages` clarification-answer path
(`POST /tasks/{id}/clarifications/{cid}/answer`) with the exact path above — a minor path
refinement, not a behavior change. Auth is the same fail-closed test-only header simulation reused
from 66B.1/66B.3 (no new auth mechanism). All four responses state `dispatch_enabled: false`; the
three mutating endpoints also state `resume_dispatch_enabled: false`. `GET /deliveries` and
everything below it in the table above remain design-only, staged for 66D–66G. See
`step66c1-workroom-clarification-api-foundation-report.md`.

API blueprint only — no endpoint implemented; no runtime change; no external action; no production
action.
