# AI Agents Team Work — Frontend Page Map (Step 66A.3)

> **Blueprint / scope only. No UI implementation, no runtime change, no external action, no production
> action.**

MVP Admin Console page map. Each page: purpose · roles · data sources · actions · RBAC · audit ·
priority.

| Page | Purpose | Primary roles | Data sources | Actions | RBAC restriction | Audit | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/tasks` | list/track tasks | Requester (own), PM, Lead, Admin | `GET /tasks` | open, filter | own-scope for Requester | view logged | P0 |
| `/tasks/new` | assign/create task (task-type select, D14) | Requester, PM, Lead, Admin | task-type taxonomy | create, submit | create per RBAC | task.created/submitted | P0 |
| `/tasks/{id}` | task detail + state | task participants | `GET /tasks/{id}` | supplement reqs, cancel | own/role-scoped | actions logged | P0 |
| `/tasks/{id}/workroom` | chat-style Agent Workroom (D9) | participants | `GET workroom` | message, answer clarification | role-based msg visibility | msg↔audit corr id | P0 |
| `/deliveries` | Delivery Inbox | PM, Lead, Reviewer | `GET /deliveries` | open | review roles | view logged | P0 |
| `/deliveries/{id}` | delivery package + acceptance gate (D5) | PM, Lead, Reviewer | `GET /deliveries/{id}` | Accept/Reject/Request-Changes/Re-run-QA/Escalate/Archive | per RBAC + D12 limit | each action audited | P0 |
| `/operator/actions` | Operator Action Center (aggregated queues) | Admin, Agent Operator, Reviewer | action-center endpoints | triage, open item | role-scoped | view logged | P0 |

| `/operator/dlq-retry` | DLQ / Retry UI (closes Step 65 gap #6) | Platform Admin, Agent Operator | retry-scheduler `/deadletter` | replay, inspect | **Admin/Agent-Op only (D13)** | replay audited | **P0** |
| `/operator/incidents` | incidents view | Admin, Agent Operator | incidents (`/admin/incidents`) | acknowledge, open | admin/agent-op | logged | P1 |
| `/notifications` | in-app notification center (D7) | all roles | `GET /notifications` | read, mark-read | own feed | read logged | P0 |
| `/settings/roles` | RBAC management | Platform Admin | role_permissions | assign roles | Admin only | change audited | P1 |
| `/settings/integrations` | integrations management | Platform Admin | integration config | configure (no secrets shown) | Admin only | change audited | P1 |
| `/settings/web-research-sources` | web-research whitelist mgmt (D10) | Platform Admin, Sec/Compliance (review) | web_research_sources | add/remove/approve source | Admin manage; Sec review | change audited | P1 |

## Navigation & visibility

- Role-aware navigation: pages/actions a role cannot use are hidden; server still enforces.
- Requester sees only own tasks + relevant workrooms + notifications.
- Operator surfaces (`/operator/*`) hidden from Requester/PM except where a specific capability applies.

## 66B.2 implementation status (2026-07-09)

`/tasks`, `/tasks/new`, `/tasks/{id}` are **implemented and deployed** on the test runtime
(`apps/admin-console/src/pages/TaskList.tsx` / `TaskNew.tsx` / `TaskDetail.tsx`), with a nav entry
("Tasks") and a full API client (`src/tasks/taskClient.ts`). Role-aware navigation is currently the
**test-only role simulation** (`TestRoleBanner`, not a real session) — server-side RBAC (Step 66B.1)
is the actual enforcement point. All other pages in the table above remain design-only, staged for
66C–66G.

## Statement

Frontend page map only — no page implemented, no runtime change, no external action, no production
action.
