# Progress Log — AI-Agents-SWD

Updated at every development stage. Each entry records: execution time,
Git branch / commit hash, modified files, deployment target, test results,
issues & blockers, and next-step suggestions.

---

## Stage 1 — Environment, GitHub & Test Server Inventory

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-21 17:59 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `2f4058d` ("Initial commit"); this inventory record is committed on top of it.
- **Modified files:**
  - `source/progress.md` (new)
- **Deployment target:** none — inventory only, no deployment performed.
- **Test results:**

  **Local development environment**
  - Repo root: `…/Documents/VS Code/AIAgent-SWD`
  - Remote `origin`: `https://github.com/coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD.git`
  - Branch `main`, working tree clean, up to date with `origin/main`
  - Latest commit: `2f4058dc32dfc5f88f32915c2c58fa96a0096f8c` — "Initial commit"
  - Content: `README.md`; empty directories `provisioning/cloud-init/` (untracked — git does not track empty directories)

  **GitHub**
  - `git push --dry-run origin main` → "Everything up-to-date" (exit 0)
  - Push capability: OK — credentials cached via Git Credential Manager

  **Test server 10.0.1.31**
  - SSH reachable via profile `aiagent-swd` (user `itadmin`, key-only authentication)
  - Host `aiagent-swd`, Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS, kernel 6.8.0-101-generic
  - Tool inventory (no packages installed — inventory only):

    | Tool           | Status  | Version       |
    |----------------|---------|---------------|
    | git            | OK      | 2.43.0        |
    | docker         | MISSING | —             |
    | docker compose | MISSING | —             |
    | python3        | OK      | 3.12.3        |
    | curl           | OK      | 8.5.0         |

- **Issues & blockers:**
  - **BLOCKER:** `docker` and `docker compose` are not installed on the test server (10.0.1.31). Any container-based deployment is blocked until they are installed. Not installed in this stage, per the "inventory only / do not install packages" instruction.
  - Minor: `provisioning/cloud-init/` exists only as empty directories; intended contents not yet defined.

- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Decide whether deployment will be container-based. If yes, install Docker Engine + Compose plugin on 10.0.1.31 — this installs packages and needs explicit approval.
  2. Confirm the intended contents/purpose of `provisioning/cloud-init/`.
  3. Establish the deployment workflow on 10.0.1.31: `git clone` / `git pull` this repo, then deploy (per project rule 5).

---

## Stage 2 — Install Docker Test-Deployment Capability on 10.0.1.31

- **Execution / install time:** 2026-05-21 18:07:27–18:07:48 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `3cdb56b`; this record is committed on top of it.
- **Modified files:**
  - `source/progress.md` (Stage 2 entry appended)
  - No application or configuration files changed in the repo.
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` (`aiagent-swd`, Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS) — Docker engine installed; **no application deployed** (per task constraint).
- **Install method:** Docker official Ubuntu apt repository (`https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu`, suite `noble stable`, signed by `/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc`). Packages installed: `docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli`, `containerd.io`, `docker-buildx-plugin`, `docker-compose-plugin` (+ dependencies `docker-ce-rootless-extras`, `pigz`).
- **Conflicting-package check (before install):** all absent — `docker.io`, `docker-compose`, `docker-compose-v2`, `docker-doc`, `podman-docker`, `containerd`, `runc`. No removals needed; clean install.
- **Test results:**
  - `docker --version` → `Docker version 29.5.2, build 79eb04c`
  - `docker compose version` → `Docker Compose version v5.1.4`
  - `systemctl status docker` → `active (running)`, unit enabled (auto-start on boot)
  - `docker run --rm hello-world` → **PASS** ("Hello from Docker!")
  - `itadmin` docker access in a fresh SSH session → `docker ps` works without `sudo`
- **docker group / re-login:**
  - `itadmin` added to group `docker` (gid 988) via `usermod -aG docker itadmin`.
  - New SSH logins pick up the group automatically — verified: `docker ps` runs without `sudo` in a fresh session.
  - The install-time shell did not gain the group immediately; any session opened before the install would need re-login (or `newgrp docker`). No action needed for new sessions.
- **Issues & blockers:** none — Docker is installed and fully functional.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - On first start `dockerd` logged benign `nftables ... No such file or directory` messages (no pre-existing rules to delete) — daemon initialized successfully; not an error.
  - No application deployed and no production resources created (per task constraints).
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Define the application with its `Dockerfile` / `compose.yaml` in the repo.
  2. Establish the deploy flow on 10.0.1.31: `git pull` latest `main`, then `docker compose up` (per project rule 5).
  3. Confirm the intended contents of `provisioning/cloud-init/`.

## Stage 3 — Monorepo Base Skeleton (Step 2)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-21 18:14–18:17 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `1ed9e98`. Step 2 produced two commits:
  - `4c973a1cb560d144bc0657ba107e8ae6fc090469` — monorepo skeleton (directories, `.gitkeep`, README, `.gitignore`)
  - this Stage 3 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `.gitignore`; 25 × `<directory>/.gitkeep` placeholders under `apps/`, `agents/`, `shared/`, `infra/`, `migrations/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`
  - Modified: `README.md` (expanded to the full project README); `source/progress.md` (this entry)
  - Deleted: none
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — **pull verification only** (no application deployed, no `docker compose` started, no production resources created).
- **Test results:**
  - Directory skeleton: 26 directories present (25 created with `.gitkeep` + the pre-existing `source/`).
  - `README.md`: rewritten with project name, purpose, repository structure, local/test deployment principle, test server, production restriction, and no-secrets policy.
  - `.gitignore`: created (Python / Node / build artifacts / logs / env & local secrets / docker local volumes / OS cruft).
  - Commit `4c973a1` pushed to `origin/main` (27 files changed).
  - Test server: `git clone` into `/home/itadmin/AI-Agents-SWD`; HEAD `4c973a1` on `main`; all 26 directories verified present (`DIR_VERIFY: PASS`); `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `source/progress.md` present.
- **Issues & blockers:** none.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - All directories are empty placeholders (`.gitkeep` only) — no application code yet.
  - The pre-existing empty `provisioning/cloud-init/` is outside this skeleton and remains untracked (not part of Step 2 scope).
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Begin implementing services/agents — start with `shared/` (sdk, models) so apps and agents have a dependency base.
  2. Add `infra/docker-compose/` definitions for local/test runs.
  3. Establish the deploy flow on 10.0.1.31: `git pull` → build → `docker compose up` (test only).

---

## Stage 4 — Docker Compose Local/Test Runtime (Step 3)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-21 18:27 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `952a189`. Step 3 produced two commits:
  - `919630b8db3f73440ea4b2d06984835e4f0999da` — Docker Compose runtime + orchestrator placeholder
  - this Stage 4 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`, `apps/orchestrator/Dockerfile`, `apps/orchestrator/requirements.txt`, `apps/orchestrator/src/main.py`
  - Modified: `README.md` (local/test runtime instructions), `.gitignore` (ignore `.claude/`), `source/progress.md` (this entry)
  - Deleted: `apps/orchestrator/.gitkeep`, `infra/docker-compose/.gitkeep` (directories now contain real files)
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — Docker Compose runtime validation (`up -d` of postgres, redis, vault, orchestrator). No application logic deployed, no production resources created.
- **Docker Compose config result:** `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml config` → **valid** (exit 0); rendered project `aiagents-test` with 4 services. Local Docker is not installed on the dev machine, so config was validated on the test server.
- **Container status** (`docker compose ps`):
  - `aiagents-test-orchestrator-1` — Up (healthy) — `127.0.0.1:8000->8000`
  - `aiagents-test-postgres-1` — Up (healthy) — `127.0.0.1:5432->5432`
  - `aiagents-test-redis-1` — Up (healthy) — `127.0.0.1:6379->6379`
  - `aiagents-test-vault-1` — Up — `127.0.0.1:8200->8200` (no healthcheck defined)
- **Health check result:** `curl http://localhost:8000/health` → `{"service":"orchestrator","status":"ok"}` — **PASS**.
- **Logs summary:**
  - orchestrator — uvicorn startup complete; `GET /health` → `200 OK`.
  - postgres — PostgreSQL 16.14 initialised; "database system is ready to accept connections" (`trust` auth, expected warning).
  - redis — Redis 7.4.9 "Ready to accept connections" (benign kernel `vm.overcommit_memory` warning).
  - vault — dev mode; core unsealed; running. Vault dev mode prints an ephemeral root token / unseal key to its own container log — intentionally **not recorded here** (no-secrets rule); it is regenerated on every restart.
- **Image versions:** postgres 16.14, redis 7.4.9, hashicorp/vault 1.17.6; orchestrator built on `python:3.12-slim` with fastapi 0.136.1 + uvicorn 0.47.0.
- **Issues & blockers:** none — all four containers started and the orchestrator health check passed on the first deployment.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - Local Docker is not installed on the Windows dev machine; compose validation and image builds run on the test server only.
  - PostgreSQL uses `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust` and Vault runs in dev mode — local/test-only choices, never for production.
  - Vault dev mode is in-memory (ephemeral); all data and tokens are lost on restart.
  - All service ports bind to `127.0.0.1` on the test server (not exposed to the wider network).
  - The runtime is left running on 10.0.1.31; stop it with `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml down`.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Implement orchestrator logic and shared libraries (`shared/sdk`, `shared/models`).
  2. Wire the orchestrator to postgres/redis once real functionality exists, using non-`trust` credentials supplied via env / a secrets manager.
  3. Add the remaining services and agents and extend the compose runtime.

## Stage 5 — PostgreSQL Migration & Redis Streams Initialization (Step 4)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-21 21:43–21:45 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `97a1e86`. Step 4 produced three commits:
  - `b8ca097` — migration SQL + 3 runtime shell scripts
  - `d91c369` — fix: correct Redis stream enumeration in the runtime scripts
  - this Stage 5 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `migrations/001_init_core_tables.sql`, `scripts/init_redis_streams.sh`, `scripts/init_local_runtime.sh`, `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` (the 3 scripts committed executable, mode 755)
  - Modified: `README.md` (database & streams initialization section); `source/progress.md` (this entry); `scripts/init_local_runtime.sh` and `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` were further modified by the fix commit `d91c369`
  - Deleted: `migrations/.gitkeep`, `scripts/.gitkeep`
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — database and Redis initialization validation (no application deployed, no production resources).
- **PostgreSQL migration result:** `migrations/001_init_core_tables.sql` applied via `psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1`. 8 core tables created — UUID primary keys; every table has `created_at`; `updated_at` on the 6 mutable tables; JSONB on `workflow_states.state` and `audit_logs.artifact_refs`; `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"`.
- **PostgreSQL table list:** `agent_executions`, `approval_requests`, `audit_logs`, `deployment_records`, `incident_records`, `prompt_versions`, `tasks`, `workflow_states` — 8 tables (`public` schema count = 8).
- **Migration idempotency test:** migration re-run a second time → every object reported `already exists, skipping`, transaction committed, exit 0 — **PASS** (re-run does not fail).
- **Redis Streams init result:** `scripts/init_redis_streams.sh` created 10 consumer groups across 9 streams — **PASS**.
- **Redis stream / group list:** `stream.tasks` (orchestrator-group, intake-agent-group), `stream.requirements` (requirement-agent-group), `stream.development` (development-agent-group), `stream.qa` (qa-agent-group), `stream.deployments` (devops-agent-group), `stream.approvals` (approval-group), `stream.audit` (audit-group), `stream.notifications` (notification-group), `stream.incidents` (incident-group) — 9 streams, 10 groups.
- **Redis init idempotency test:** init re-run → all 10 groups reported `exists` (BUSYGROUP handled), exit 0 — **PASS** (re-run does not fail).
- **Runtime state check result** (`check_runtime_state.sh`): 4 containers Up (orchestrator/postgres/redis healthy, vault up); 8 PostgreSQL tables; 9 Redis streams / 10 consumer groups; orchestrator `/health` → `{"service":"orchestrator","status":"ok"}` — **PASS**.
- **Issues & blockers:** none outstanding.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - One bug was found and fixed during verification: a `docker compose exec` inside a `while read` pipe consumed the loop's stdin, so the stream check listed only the first stream. Fixed in commit `d91c369` (read the stream list into a variable, then iterate). Migration and stream creation were never affected — only the check display; re-verified with all 9 streams listed.
  - Local Docker is not installed on the dev machine; shell scripts were syntax-checked with `bash -n` locally; full validation ran on the test server.
  - PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain local/test-only choices, never for production.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Implement orchestrator logic and shared libraries that use the new schema and streams.
  2. Establish a migration versioning convention for future migrations (`002_*.sql`, ...).
  3. Add `updated_at` auto-update triggers if application code will not maintain that column.

## Stage 6 — Shared SDK & Base Agent (Step 5)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-21 22:00–22:07 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `199e612`. Step 5 produced four commits:
  - `fe13fab` — shared SDK packages, tests, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `run_tests.sh`
  - `fca19ae` — type `AuditClient.event_bus` for mypy correctness
  - `795fb38` — apply black formatting
  - this Stage 6 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `shared/` SDK packages — `base_agent/base.py`, `event_bus/redis_streams.py`, `audit/client.py`, `policy/client.py`, `models/workflow.py`, `models/events.py`, `models/audit.py`, plus 7 `__init__.py`; `tests/` — 5 test files; `pyproject.toml`; `requirements.txt`; `scripts/run_tests.sh` (executable)
  - Modified: `README.md` (Shared SDK + Testing sections); `source/progress.md` (this entry)
  - Deleted: `shared/sdk/.gitkeep`, `shared/models/.gitkeep`, `tests/.gitkeep`
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — SDK test validation (no application deployed, no production resources).
- **Test results:** `pytest` — **22 passed** (0.13s). `ruff check` — all checks passed. `black --check` — all 20 files clean. `mypy` — success, no issues in 14 source files.
  - BaseAgent (7 tests): abstract class cannot be instantiated directly; `DummyAgent` subclass instantiates and runs `receive_task`/`analyze`/`execute`; `request_approval` returns allowed for non-restricted and approval-required for restricted actions; `write_audit` and `report` work — PASS.
  - PolicyClient (4 tests): all 8 restricted actions blocked (`allowed=false`, `approval_required=true`); non-restricted and unknown actions allowed — PASS.
  - AuditClient (3 tests): `build_audit_event` produces a valid `AuditEvent` with all required fields; defaults applied; `write_audit_event` returns None without an event bus — PASS.
  - Redis Streams (4 tests): `REDIS_URL` env / default / explicit-override resolution; live publish→consume→ack cycle — PASS.
  - Pydantic models (4 tests): `WorkflowState`, `AgentEvent`, `TaskCreatedEvent`, `AuditEvent` build and JSON round-trip — PASS.
- **Redis integration result:** the integration test ran against the live test Redis (`REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379`): `ensure_group` (idempotent), `publish_event`, `consume_events`, and `ack_event` verified against a temporary `test.stream.*` stream which was deleted afterward — PASS.
- **Runtime state:** `check_runtime_state.sh` — 4 containers Up (orchestrator/postgres/redis healthy, vault up); 8 PostgreSQL tables; 9 Redis streams / 10 groups; orchestrator `/health` OK.
- **Issues & blockers:** none outstanding.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The test server lacked `python3-venv`; it was installed (`apt-get install python3-venv python3.12-venv`) so the venv could be created, as required by the task's venv step.
  - The first test run flagged 4 files via `black --check` (line-wrapping at the 100-char limit); fixed in commit `795fb38` and re-verified fully green. `pytest`, `ruff`, and `mypy` passed from the first run.
  - Local Docker and Python dependencies are not installed on the dev machine; the local check was `py_compile` only; the full test run executed on the test server inside a venv.
  - No real LLM, GitHub, or Slack calls; no secrets committed; PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Implement a concrete agent (e.g. intake-agent) on top of `BaseAgent`.
  2. Wire the orchestrator to the SDK (event bus, audit, policy clients).
  3. Add a CI workflow that runs `scripts/run_tests.sh` automatically.

## Stage 7 — LangGraph Orchestrator Workflow Skeleton (Step 6)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-21 22:17–22:20 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `5f46410`. Step 6 produced three commits:
  - `55a23b5` — LangGraph workflow skeleton, API endpoints, tests, Docker/compose updates
  - `d4813ca` — apply black formatting to workflow.py
  - this Stage 7 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `apps/orchestrator/src/workflow.py`, `tests/test_orchestrator_workflow.py`, `tests/test_orchestrator_api.py`, `.dockerignore`
  - Modified: `apps/orchestrator/src/main.py`, `apps/orchestrator/requirements.txt`, `apps/orchestrator/Dockerfile`, `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`, `scripts/run_tests.sh`, `README.md`, `source/progress.md`
  - Deleted: none
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — orchestrator workflow validation (no production resources; no production action executed).
- **WorkflowState schema:** TypedDict with 12 fields — `task_id`, `source`, `request`, `stage`, `artifacts`, `assigned_agents`, `approval_required`, `approval_status`, `retry_count`, `audit_refs`, `risk_level`, `execution_result`.
- **LangGraph nodes:** `intake → requirement → policy → approval → audit → final` (6 nodes; linear graph compiled via `langgraph` 1.2.0).
- **API endpoints:** `GET /health`, `POST /workflow/test`, `POST /workflow/policy-test`, `GET /workflow/schema`.
- **Unit/API test results:** `pytest` — **34 passed** (22 SDK/model tests + 12 new orchestrator tests). `ruff` — all checks passed. `black --check` — all 23 files clean. `mypy` — success, no issues in 14 source files.
- **Docker rebuild result:** orchestrator image rebuilt from the repo-root build context (so the `shared` package is importable in the container); `langgraph` 1.2.0 and dependencies installed; container recreated and healthy.
- **Runtime smoke test result** (`check_runtime_state.sh`): 4 containers Up; 8 PostgreSQL tables; 9 Redis streams / 10 groups; `/health` OK; `/workflow/schema` returns all 12 fields; NON_PROD_SMOKE PASS; PROD_APPROVAL_SMOKE PASS.
- **Policy / approval behavior:**
  - `/workflow/test` non-production (`dev.test`) → `stage: completed`, `approval_required: false`, `production_executed: false`.
  - `/workflow/test` `production.deploy` → `stage: waiting_approval`, `approval_required: true`, `approval_status: pending`, `risk_level: high`, `execution_result: blocked_pending_approval`, `production_executed: false`. **No production action was executed.**
- **Audit stream publish result:** `stream.audit` grew from 0 to 10 entries during verification — the workflow `audit_node` published audit events for both the non-production and the production.deploy runs. (Audit events carry task_id / agent / decision / summary only; no secrets or tokens.)
- **Issues & blockers:** none outstanding.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The first test run flagged `workflow.py` via `black --check` (one dict line at 101 chars); fixed in commit `d4813ca` and re-verified fully green. `pytest`, `ruff`, and `mypy` passed from the first run.
  - The orchestrator build context is now the repository root; `.dockerignore` excludes `.venv`, caches, and `.git` from the image.
  - The workflow skeleton performs no LLM calls, no GitHub/Slack calls, and no production actions; `production.deploy` only reaches `waiting_approval`.
  - PostgreSQL `trust` auth, Vault dev mode, and the placeholder `DATABASE_URL` remain local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Implement real approval handling (consume `stream.approvals` and resume the workflow).
  2. Connect the workflow to PostgreSQL (persist `workflow_states` rows).
  3. Implement concrete agents and dispatch tasks over the Redis Streams event bus.

## Stage 8 — Approval / Policy / Audit Service Split (Step 7)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-22 09:55–10:09 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `f808124`. Step 7 produced two commits:
  - `a242ea95ff615297ec7119970ca6f4a0d90a1214` — governance service split, HTTP
    clients, orchestrator integration, migration, compose, tests, scripts, README
  - this Stage 8 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `apps/policy-engine/{src/main.py,Dockerfile,requirements.txt}`,
    `apps/approval-engine/{src/main.py,Dockerfile,requirements.txt}`,
    `apps/audit-service/{src/main.py,Dockerfile,requirements.txt}`,
    `shared/sdk/http_clients/{__init__.py,policy_http_client.py,approval_http_client.py,audit_http_client.py}`,
    `migrations/002_governance_tables.sql`,
    `tests/{conftest.py,test_policy_engine.py,test_approval_engine.py,test_audit_service.py,test_orchestrator_service_integration.py}`
  - Modified: `apps/orchestrator/src/{workflow.py,main.py}`,
    `apps/orchestrator/requirements.txt`, `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`,
    `requirements.txt`, `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`,
    `scripts/init_local_runtime.sh`, `tests/{test_orchestrator_workflow.py,test_orchestrator_api.py}`,
    `README.md`, `source/progress.md`
  - Deleted: `apps/policy-engine/.gitkeep`, `apps/approval-engine/.gitkeep`,
    `apps/audit-service/.gitkeep`
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — governance service validation
  (no production resources; no production action executed).
- **Service ports:** orchestrator `8000`, policy-engine `8001`, approval-engine
  `8002`, audit-service `8003` — all bound to `127.0.0.1`.
- **Service integration result:** the orchestrator workflow no longer uses local
  mock logic — `policy`, `approval`, and `audit` nodes call the governance
  services over HTTP via `PolicyHttpClient` / `ApprovalHttpClient` /
  `AuditHttpClient` (URLs from `POLICY_ENGINE_URL` / `APPROVAL_ENGINE_URL` /
  `AUDIT_SERVICE_URL`, localhost fallback). Verified end-to-end: the
  `production.deploy` smoke run created an `approval_requests` row with
  `requested_by = orchestrator` and an `audit_logs` row with `agent = orchestrator`.
- **PostgreSQL persistence result:** `migrations/002_governance_tables.sql` applied
  (11 × `ALTER TABLE`, 2 × `CREATE INDEX`) — idempotent, re-run safe. After
  verification: `approval_requests` = 11 rows, `audit_logs` = 15 rows.
  `production.deploy` task `step7-prod-001` persisted as
  `action = production.deploy`, `risk_level = high`, `status = pending`.
- **Redis stream result:** `stream.approvals` XLEN = 14, `stream.audit` XLEN = 31.
  approval-engine publishes `approval.requested` / `approval.approved` /
  `approval.rejected`; audit-service publishes `audit.recorded`.
- **Test results:** `run_tests.sh` — `pytest` **49 passed** (1.65s); `ruff` all
  checks passed; `black --check` 35 files clean; `mypy` no issues in 18 files.
  - policy-engine (4 tests): restricted actions → `approval_required: true`,
    `risk_level: high`; non-restricted → `allowed: true`, `risk_level: low` — PASS.
  - approval-engine (6 tests): health; request create → `pending`; get; approve →
    `approved`; reject → `rejected`; unknown id → 404 — PASS.
  - audit-service (3 tests): health; event insert → query by task_id with
    `artifact_refs` round-trip; unknown task → `count: 0` — PASS.
  - orchestrator integration (3 tests): non-production routes through the live
    services to `completed`; `production.deploy` creates a queryable
    `approval_requests` row; both Redis streams grow — PASS.
- **Runtime smoke test:** `check_runtime_state.sh` — 7 containers Up
  (orchestrator/policy/approval/audit/postgres/redis healthy, vault up); governance
  `/health` all PASS; APPROVAL_SMOKE PASS (request → approve); AUDIT_SMOKE PASS
  (insert → query). Orchestrator workflow smoke:
  - `step7-dev-001` (`dev.test`) → `stage: completed`, `approval_required: false`,
    `production_executed: false`.
  - `step7-prod-001` (`production.deploy`) → `stage: waiting_approval`,
    `approval_required: true`, `approval_status: pending`,
    `approval_request_id: dbb6cdbc-…`, `risk_level: high`,
    `execution_result: blocked_pending_approval`. **No production action executed.**
- **Issues & blockers:** none — all build, migration, test, and verification steps
  passed on the first run; no fix commit was required.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The orchestrator HTTP clients fail safe: if the policy-engine is unreachable
    the workflow requires approval; if the approval/audit services are unreachable
    it degrades to a local reference. The dependency-bound tests skip gracefully
    when their service / database / Redis is not reachable.
  - `migrations/002` relaxes the `approval_requests.task_id` foreign key to `TEXT`
    so mock/test task ids are accepted; `audit_logs.action` is made nullable.
  - PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain local/test-only choices.
  - No real LLM / GitHub / Slack calls; no secrets committed; `production.deploy`
    only reaches `waiting_approval`.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Implement approval resumption — consume `stream.approvals` so an approved
     request resumes the blocked workflow.
  2. Persist `workflow_states` rows so workflow progress survives a restart.
  3. Add a communication-gateway service and wire notifications
     (`stream.notifications`).

## Stage 9 — Workflow Persistence & Resume Engine (Step 8)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-22 12:55–13:09 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `3408c0f`. Step 8 produced two commits:
  - `fddd1cb5958338ef499999c2a0f250943abf4276` — workflow persistence layer,
    resume engine, approval-resume listener, persistence/replay API, migration,
    tests, runtime checks, README
  - this Stage 9 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `shared/sdk/workflow_store/{__init__.py,store.py}`,
    `apps/orchestrator/src/resume_engine.py`,
    `migrations/003_workflow_persistence.sql`,
    `tests/{test_workflow_store.py,test_resume_engine.py,test_workflow_persistence.py,test_approval_resume_flow.py}`
  - Modified: `apps/orchestrator/src/{workflow.py,main.py}`,
    `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`, `README.md`, `source/progress.md`
  - Deleted: none
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — workflow persistence / resume
  validation (no production resources; no production action executed).
- **Workflow persistence result:** `migrations/003_workflow_persistence.sql`
  applied (9 × `ALTER TABLE`, 2 × `CREATE INDEX`) — idempotent. `WorkflowStore`
  (asyncpg) writes one row per workflow into `workflow_states`; the workflow
  creates the row at start and updates it after every node transition. Verified:
  `GET /workflow/step8-prod-001` returns the full persisted state; the `state`
  JSONB column carries the complete LangGraph state.
- **Resume engine result:** `ResumeEngine.resume_workflow` transitions an
  approved `waiting_approval` workflow to `completed` — mock-safe: only
  bookkeeping is updated (`execution_result.resumed = true`,
  `production_executed = false`); no production action runs.
  `resume_approved_workflows` reconciles `waiting_approval` workflows against the
  approval-engine on startup.
- **Replay API result:** `GET /workflow/replay/step8-prod-001` returns the
  persisted state with `executed: false` — no workflow execution is triggered.
  `GET /workflow` lists all persisted workflows; `GET /workflow/{task_id}`
  returns one.
- **Approval resume flow result:**
  - API path — `POST /workflow/resume/step8-prod-001` after approval →
    `stage: completed`, `resumed: true`, `production_executed: false`. An
    unapproved workflow returns `409`.
  - Redis path — the orchestrator opens consumer group
    `orchestrator-resume-group` on `stream.approvals` (`XREADGROUP BLOCK`, no
    polling). `step8-listener-001` was approved and the listener resumed it to
    `completed` within ~4s. The consumer group reported `entries-read: 42`,
    `pending: 0`, `lag: 0` — every approval event consumed and acked.
- **PostgreSQL workflow_states query:** 34 rows. `step8-prod-001` and
  `step8-listener-001` → `completed / approved`; `step8-dev-001` → `completed /
  not_required`; `smoke-prod` → `waiting_approval / pending`.
- **Redis approval event handling:** `stream.approvals` XLEN = 42,
  `stream.audit` XLEN = 69. Consumer group `orchestrator-resume-group` active
  with 1 consumer, fully caught up.
- **Restart survivability result:** `docker compose restart orchestrator` —
  orchestrator healthy after restart; `GET /workflow/replay/step8-prod-001` and
  `GET /workflow/replay/step8-listener-001` both still return the full persisted
  state. Workflow state is held in PostgreSQL, so nothing is lost on restart.
- **Test results:** `run_tests.sh` — `pytest` **69 passed** (5.61s); `ruff` all
  checks passed; `black --check` 42 files clean; `mypy` no issues in 20 files.
  - workflow store (5 tests): create/get/update/list/filter; append_artifact /
    append_audit_ref — PASS.
  - resume engine (6 tests): replay; unapproved/unknown → `ResumeError`;
    approved → `completed`; `on_approval_event` approved/rejected — PASS.
  - workflow persistence (4 tests): non-production and `waiting_approval`
    workflows persisted; full state stored; replay matches — PASS.
  - approval resume flow (5 tests): `on_approval_event` approve/reject; resume
    API rejects unapproved (409) and resumes approved; Redis listener resumes
    after approval — PASS.
- **Runtime smoke test:** `check_runtime_state.sh` — 7 containers Up;
  WORKFLOW_PERSISTENCE_SMOKE / WORKFLOW_REPLAY_SMOKE / APPROVAL_RESUME_SMOKE all
  PASS, alongside the existing health / approval / audit smoke tests.
- **Issues & blockers:** none — all build, migration, test, and verification
  steps passed on the first run; no fix commit was required.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - Persistence is best-effort inside the workflow: a database outage is logged
    and swallowed so the workflow still runs; resume/replay then require the
    database and surface `503` when it is unreachable.
  - Resume is mock-safe — a resumed `production.deploy` reaches `completed` with
    `production_executed: false`; no production action is ever executed.
  - The approval listener uses a Redis consumer group (`XREADGROUP BLOCK`); the
    startup scan recovers approvals that landed before the group existed.
  - PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Add a communication-gateway service and emit notifications on resume /
     reject (`stream.notifications`).
  2. Implement concrete agents that consume `stream.tasks` and report progress.
  3. Add workflow retry / failure handling and persist `retry_count`
     transitions.

## Stage 10 — Communication Gateway & Notification Flow (Step 9)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-22 13:18–13:30 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `7bc219d`. Step 9 produced two commits:
  - `85292184040406f8a573242cd71457437aaacd67` — communication-gateway service,
    notification client, orchestrator notification publishing, docker-compose,
    tests, runtime checks, README
  - this Stage 10 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `apps/communication-gateway/{src/main.py,Dockerfile,requirements.txt}`,
    `shared/sdk/notifications/{__init__.py,client.py}`,
    `tests/{test_notification_client.py,test_communication_gateway.py,test_notification_flow.py}`
  - Modified: `apps/orchestrator/src/{workflow.py,resume_engine.py}`,
    `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`, `tests/conftest.py`,
    `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`, `README.md`, `source/progress.md`
  - Deleted: `apps/communication-gateway/.gitkeep`
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — communication-gateway /
  notification validation (no production resources; no production action executed).
- **Service ports:** orchestrator `8000`, policy-engine `8001`, approval-engine
  `8002`, audit-service `8003`, communication-gateway `8004` — all bound to
  `127.0.0.1`.
- **Service integration result:** `communication-gateway` (port 8004) is the
  entry point for mock intake and notifications. `POST /intake/mock` forwards to
  the orchestrator `POST /workflow/test`; `GET /tasks/{task_id}` proxies the
  orchestrator `GET /workflow/{task_id}`. The `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` and `REDIS_URL`
  are read from the environment. No real Slack / Discord / Telegram / GitHub /
  LLM calls are made.
- **Notification stream result:** notifications are published to the
  `stream.notifications` Redis stream via `NotificationClient`
  (`shared/sdk/notifications/client.py`). After verification `stream.notifications`
  XLEN = 47. Each notification carries `task_id`, `event_type`, `message`,
  `created_at`. `GET /notifications` reads recent entries with `XREVRANGE`.
- **Mock intake result:**
  - `/intake/mock` non-production (`step9-dev-001`, `dev.test`) → `stage:
    completed`, `approval_required: false`, `production_executed: false`.
  - `/intake/mock` `production.deploy` (`step9-prod-001`) → `stage:
    waiting_approval`, `approval_required: true`, `production_executed: false`.
    **No production action executed.**
  - `GET /tasks/step9-prod-001` returned the persisted workflow state.
- **Production approval notification result:** the orchestrator publishes a
  notification at every workflow outcome — verified `workflow.completed`
  (`step9-dev-001`), `workflow.waiting_approval` (`step9-prod-001`),
  `workflow.resumed` and `workflow.rejected` (resume-engine paths) all present in
  `stream.notifications`.
- **Test results:** `run_tests.sh` — `pytest` **80 passed** (6.45s); `ruff` all
  checks passed; `black --check` 48 files clean; `mypy` no issues in 22 files.
  - notification client (3 tests): build / publish+list / `send_notification`
    helper — PASS.
  - communication gateway (5 tests): health; mock intake non-production and
    `production.deploy`; `/tasks/{id}`; `/notifications/test` + `/notifications`
    — PASS.
  - notification flow (3 tests): intake completion publishes
    `workflow.completed`; `production.deploy` publishes `workflow.waiting_approval`
    with `production_executed: false`; `/notifications/test` reaches the stream —
    PASS.
- **Runtime smoke test:** `check_runtime_state.sh` — 8 containers Up;
  communication-gateway HEALTH PASS; INTAKE_NONPROD_SMOKE / INTAKE_PROD_SMOKE /
  NOTIFICATIONS_SMOKE all PASS, alongside the existing health / approval / audit /
  persistence / replay / resume smoke tests.
- **Issues & blockers:** none — all build, test, and verification steps passed on
  the first run; no fix commit was required.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The communication-gateway is a mock entry point — it performs no real
    external messaging; `/notifications` only reads a Redis stream.
  - Notification publishing from the orchestrator is best-effort: a Redis outage
    is swallowed so the workflow still completes.
  - `production.deploy` continues to stop at `waiting_approval`; no production
    action is executed anywhere in the intake → notification path.
  - PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Implement concrete agents that consume `stream.tasks` and report progress
     back through the event bus.
  2. Add a notification consumer that turns `stream.notifications` events into
     real channel deliveries (Slack / Discord / Telegram) behind a feature flag.
  3. Add workflow retry / failure handling and persist `retry_count` transitions.

## Stage 11 — Concrete Agents: Intake Agent & Requirement Agent (Step 10)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-22 13:43–13:55 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `d0e280b`. Step 10 produced two commits:
  - `bd6b34b0d31e02ae80a40978abfe0c91211950ca` — intake-agent and requirement-agent
    services, stream pipeline, gateway publish_to_stream, docker-compose, tests,
    runtime checks, README
  - this Stage 11 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `agents/intake-agent/{src/agent.py,src/main.py,Dockerfile,requirements.txt}`,
    `agents/requirement-agent/{src/agent.py,src/main.py,Dockerfile,requirements.txt}`,
    `tests/{test_intake_agent.py,test_requirement_agent.py,test_agent_stream_flow.py}`
  - Modified: `apps/communication-gateway/src/main.py`,
    `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`, `tests/conftest.py`,
    `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`, `README.md`, `source/progress.md`
  - Deleted: `agents/intake-agent/.gitkeep`, `agents/requirement-agent/.gitkeep`
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — agent stream-pipeline
  validation (no production resources; no production action executed).
- **Agent ports:** intake-agent `8010`, requirement-agent `8011` — both bound to
  `127.0.0.1`. (Platform services remain `8000`–`8004`.)
- **Agent service result:** both agents are standalone FastAPI services that
  subclass the shared `BaseAgent`, run a Redis Streams consumer-group loop in
  their lifespan, and expose `GET /health` and `GET /status`. After the flow run
  each agent's `/status` reported `running: true` with the processed count and
  the last task id (`step10-flow-001`).
- **Redis stream flow result:** verified end-to-end —
  `stream.tasks → intake-agent → stream.requirements → requirement-agent →
  stream.development`. For `step10-flow-001`: `stream.requirements` carried a
  `task.intake_completed` event (`normalized_by: intake-agent`);
  `stream.development` carried a `requirement.completed` event with a
  `requirement_spec` artifact (`produced_by: requirement-agent`). The chain
  reached `stream.development` within ~2s.
- **Audit / notification result:** both agents wrote to `stream.audit` —
  `intake-agent` (`decision_type: intake`) and `requirement-agent`
  (`decision_type: requirement`) — and published to `stream.notifications` —
  `agent.intake_completed` and `requirement.completed`. Final stream lengths:
  `stream.tasks` 5, `stream.requirements` 5, `stream.development` 5,
  `stream.audit` 159, `stream.notifications` 101.
- **Test results:** `run_tests.sh` — `pytest` **91 passed** (8.74s); `ruff` all
  checks passed; `black --check` 55 files clean; `mypy` no issues in 22 files.
  - intake-agent (4 tests): health; status; `receive_task` normalization;
    `analyze` request-type extraction — PASS.
  - requirement-agent (4 tests): health; status; `receive_task`; `analyze`
    summary — PASS.
  - agent stream flow (3 tests): intake-agent forwards to `stream.requirements`;
    requirement-agent emits `requirement.completed` to `stream.development`;
    both agents write audit events and publish notifications — PASS.
- **Runtime smoke test:** `check_runtime_state.sh` — 10 containers Up; intake-agent
  and requirement-agent HEALTH PASS; AGENT_STREAM_FLOW_SMOKE PASS
  (`stream.requirements` and `stream.development` both grew), alongside the
  existing health / approval / audit / persistence / replay / resume / gateway /
  notification smoke tests.
- **Issues & blockers:** none — all build, test, and verification steps passed on
  the first run; no fix commit was required.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The agents perform no LLM / GitHub / Slack calls; the `requirement_spec` is a
    mock artifact (`mock: true`). No production action is executed.
  - Each agent runs a Redis consumer group (`XREADGROUP BLOCK`) — no polling; a
    bad message is logged and skipped so the loop keeps running.
  - The communication-gateway `/intake/mock` keeps its default orchestrator mode;
    `publish_to_stream: true` is opt-in for the agent pipeline.
  - PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Add the development / QA / DevOps agents to extend the pipeline
     (`stream.development → stream.qa → stream.deployments`).
  2. Wire the orchestrator workflow to dispatch real tasks onto `stream.tasks`
     instead of running every stage in-process.
  3. Persist agent executions to the `agent_executions` table for traceability.

## Stage 12 — Agent Execution Persistence & Development / QA / DevOps Pipeline (Step 11)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-22 14:10–14:22 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `977c53d`. Step 11 produced two commits:
  - `6dbfd8458ea17c3bc4f8213ea539dd5c35402df3` — agent execution persistence,
    StreamAgent base, development/QA/DevOps agents, migration, gateway endpoint,
    compose, tests, runtime checks, README
  - this Stage 12 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `migrations/004_agent_execution_persistence.sql`,
    `shared/sdk/agent_execution/{__init__.py,store.py}`,
    `shared/sdk/base_agent/stream_agent.py`,
    `agents/development-agent/`, `agents/qa-agent/`, `agents/devops-agent/`
    (each `src/agent.py`, `src/main.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`),
    `tests/{test_agent_execution_store.py,test_development_agent.py,test_qa_agent.py,test_devops_agent.py,test_full_agent_pipeline.py}`
  - Modified: `agents/intake-agent/{src/agent.py,requirements.txt}`,
    `agents/requirement-agent/{src/agent.py,requirements.txt}`,
    `apps/communication-gateway/{src/main.py,requirements.txt}`,
    `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`, `tests/conftest.py`,
    `tests/{test_intake_agent.py,test_requirement_agent.py}`,
    `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`, `README.md`, `source/progress.md`
  - Deleted: `agents/qa-agent/.gitkeep`, `agents/devops-agent/.gitkeep`
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — agent pipeline + execution
  persistence validation (no production resources; no production deploy executed).
- **Agent ports:** intake-agent `8010`, requirement-agent `8011`,
  development-agent `8012`, qa-agent `8013`, devops-agent `8014` — all bound to
  `127.0.0.1`.
- **Agent service result:** intake-agent and requirement-agent were refactored
  onto the new shared `StreamAgent` base; development-agent, qa-agent, and
  devops-agent were added. All five subclass `StreamAgent` (a `BaseAgent`), run a
  Redis consumer-group loop, and expose `GET /health` and `GET /status`. After
  the pipeline run each `/status` reported `running: true`, `failed_count: 0`,
  and the last task id.
- **Redis stream flow result:** verified end-to-end —
  `stream.tasks → intake-agent → stream.requirements → requirement-agent →
  stream.development → development-agent → stream.qa → qa-agent →
  stream.deployments → devops-agent`. Task `step11-flow-001` reached
  `stream.deployments` within ~2s. Final stream lengths: tasks / requirements /
  development / qa / deployments all 13; `stream.audit` 253;
  `stream.notifications` 200.
- **Execution persistence result:** `migrations/004_agent_execution_persistence.sql`
  applied (idempotent). `AgentExecutionStore` (asyncpg) records one
  `agent_executions` row per message. For `step11-flow-001` all five agents
  (intake / requirement / development / qa / devops) have a `completed` row with
  `started_at` and `completed_at` set. `GET /executions?task_id=step11-flow-001`
  returned 5 executions; `GET /executions?agent=devops-agent&status=completed`
  filtered correctly.
- **Deployment mock result:** the devops-agent wrote one `deployment_records`
  row for `step11-flow-001` — `environment: test`, `status: simulated`,
  `production_executed: false`, `mock: true`. **No production deployment was
  performed and no Kubernetes / cloud / GitHub API was called.**
- **Audit / notification result:** every agent wrote an audit event to
  `stream.audit` and published a notification to `stream.notifications`
  (`agent.intake_completed`, `requirement.completed`, `development.completed`,
  `qa.completed`, `devops.deployment_simulated`).
- **Test results:** `run_tests.sh` — `pytest` **106 passed** (12.99s); `ruff`
  all checks passed; `black --check` 69 files clean; `mypy` no issues in 25 files.
  - agent execution store (5 tests): create / complete / fail / update+get /
    list with filters — PASS.
  - development / qa / devops agents (3 tests each): health; status; the mock
    artifact builder — PASS.
  - full agent pipeline (3 tests): task reaches `stream.qa` and
    `stream.deployments`; all five agents record `completed` executions; the
    devops execution metadata is mock-safe (`production_executed: false`) — PASS.
- **Runtime smoke test:** `check_runtime_state.sh` — 13 containers Up; all five
  agents HEALTH PASS; FULL_PIPELINE_SMOKE PASS; AGENT_EXECUTIONS_SMOKE PASS
  (5 completed rows); DEPLOYMENT_RECORD_SMOKE PASS — alongside the existing
  health / approval / audit / persistence / replay / resume / gateway /
  notification smoke tests.
- **Issues & blockers:** none — all build, migration, test, and verification
  steps passed on the first run; no fix commit was required.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The agents make no LLM / GitHub / Slack / Kubernetes / cloud calls; every
    artifact (`code_change`, `test_report`, `deployment_record`) is a mock
    (`mock: true`). The devops-agent never deploys to production.
  - Execution / audit / notification writes are best-effort: a database or Redis
    outage is swallowed so the consumer loop keeps running.
  - PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Wire the orchestrator workflow to dispatch real tasks onto `stream.tasks`
     so the LangGraph workflow and the agent pipeline are one flow.
  2. Add retry / dead-letter handling for messages an agent fails to process.
  3. Surface `agent_executions` and `deployment_records` in an observability
     dashboard or a consolidated status endpoint.

## Stage 13 — Orchestrator-to-Agent Unified Workflow Dispatch (Step 12)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-24 07:59–08:02 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `2bbf8f7`. Step 12 produces
  two commits:
  - `f61cdd805e2c5da3448333549d344aa76bae7bcf` — orchestrator dispatch refactor,
    workflow event consumer, progress API, event correlation, dead-letter
    foundation, 4 new test files, 8 updated test files, runtime scripts, README
  - this Stage 13 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `apps/orchestrator/src/{dispatch.py,progress.py,workflow_events.py}`,
    `tests/{test_orchestrator_dispatch.py,test_workflow_progress.py,test_event_correlation.py,test_deadletter_foundation.py}`
  - Modified: `apps/orchestrator/src/{main.py,workflow.py,resume_engine.py}`,
    `shared/sdk/event_bus/redis_streams.py`,
    `shared/sdk/base_agent/stream_agent.py`,
    `agents/{intake-agent,requirement-agent,development-agent,qa-agent,devops-agent}/src/agent.py`,
    `scripts/{check_runtime_state.sh,init_redis_streams.sh}`,
    `tests/{test_orchestrator_workflow.py,test_orchestrator_api.py,test_workflow_persistence.py,test_orchestrator_service_integration.py,test_notification_flow.py,test_resume_engine.py,test_approval_resume_flow.py,test_communication_gateway.py}`,
    `README.md`, `source/progress.md`
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — unified dispatch + agent
  pipeline + progress / correlation / dead-letter validation. **No production
  resources were created and no production deployment was executed.**
- **Workflow dispatch result:** the orchestrator workflow's terminal node is
  now `dispatch_node` (`apps/orchestrator/src/workflow.py`). It publishes
  `task.created` (`task_id`, `workflow_id`, `request`, `source`,
  `requested_at`) to `stream.tasks` and sets `stage: dispatched`,
  `execution_result.status: awaiting_agents`. The smoke responses confirm it:
  `smoke-dev` reached `stage: dispatched` with
  `execution_result.dispatched: true, production_executed: false, mock: true`;
  `smoke-prod` (production.deploy) stayed at `waiting_approval` with
  `execution_result.dispatched: false` — **a restricted action is not
  dispatched until it is approved**. An approved restricted action is
  dispatched by the resume engine (`smoke-resume-3896681` reached
  `stage: completed` via the agent pipeline after the approval listener
  resumed it).
- **Agent completion integration:** the orchestrator opens a Redis consumer
  group `orchestrator-workflow-group` on `stream.development`, `stream.qa`,
  `stream.deployments`, and `stream.devops`
  (`apps/orchestrator/src/workflow_events.py`).
  `requirement.completed` / `development.completed` / `qa.completed` move the
  workflow to `in_progress`; `devops.deployment_simulated` moves it to
  `completed` and writes `deployment_record_id` into `execution_result`. End
  to end: `smoke-e2e-3896681` went
  `gateway → /workflow/test → dispatched → agent pipeline →
  devops.deployment_simulated → workflow.stage: completed`, with
  `deployment_record_id: 14f74894-972f-4d42-bbad-ed57a5849c71`.
- **Workflow progress result:** `GET /workflow/progress/{task_id}` returns
  `current_stage`, `completed_agents`, `pending_agents`, `failed_agents`,
  `execution_status` (`waiting_approval` / `dispatched` / `in_progress` /
  `completed` / `failed`), `approval_status`, `workflow_id`, and timestamps
  including per-agent `started_at`/`completed_at`
  (`apps/orchestrator/src/progress.py`). PROGRESS_API_SMOKE for
  `smoke-e2e-3896681` returned `execution_status: completed`,
  `completed_agents: [intake-agent, requirement-agent, development-agent,
  qa-agent, devops-agent]`, `pending_agents: []`.
- **Event correlation result:** every pipeline message carries `task_id` **and**
  `workflow_id` via `StreamAgent.correlation_ids`. The persisted state for
  `smoke-e2e-3896681` carries `workflow_id: wf-d13dba799e01`, the
  `devops.deployment_simulated` event in `stream.devops` carries the same
  workflow_id, and the deployment_records `metadata` JSONB carries it too.
- **Dead-letter foundation result:** `shared/sdk/event_bus/redis_streams.py`
  adds `retry_count` / `max_retries` metadata, `with_incremented_retry`,
  `is_retry_exhausted`, `build_dead_letter_event`, and `publish_dead_letter`.
  `StreamAgent._handle_failure` re-publishes a failed message with
  `retry_count + 1`; once `retry_count >= max_retries` it routes the event to
  `stream.deadletter` instead. DEADLETTER_SMOKE grew `stream.deadletter` from
  2 to 3.
- **Deployment correlation result:** the devops-agent's
  `_persist_deployment_record` now `INSERT ... RETURNING id`; the
  `devops.deployment_simulated` event carries `deployment_record_id` and
  `workflow_id`; the orchestrator's workflow-event consumer persists the
  `deployment_record_id` into `workflow_states.execution_result`
  (`smoke-e2e-3896681` ended with
  `execution_result.deployment_record_id: 14f74894-972f-4d42-bbad-ed57a5849c71`).
- **Test results:** `run_tests.sh` on the server — `pytest` **128 passed**
  (20.11s); `ruff check` all checks passed; `black --check` 76 files clean;
  `mypy shared/` no issues in 25 source files.
  - New pytest files: `test_orchestrator_dispatch.py` (3 tests: non-prod
    publishes `task.created`; production.deploy is not dispatched without
    approval; approved production.deploy is dispatched);
    `test_workflow_progress.py` (8 tests: 6 pure unit tests for
    `build_progress` + 2 API tests); `test_event_correlation.py` (3 tests:
    2 pure unit tests + 1 end-to-end workflow_id propagation);
    `test_deadletter_foundation.py` (8 tests: 5 pure unit tests +
    `publish_dead_letter` integration + retry re-enqueue + exhausted-retry
    dead-letter routing).
  - Locally (Windows, no infra): 65 passed, 63 skipped, 0 failures. On the
    test server (full stack): 128 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failures.
- **Runtime smoke test:** `check_runtime_state.sh` on the server — 13
  containers Up (healthy); all health endpoints PASS; the existing
  HEALTH / NON_PROD / PROD_APPROVAL / APPROVAL / AUDIT / WORKFLOW_PERSISTENCE /
  WORKFLOW_REPLAY / APPROVAL_RESUME / INTAKE_NONPROD / INTAKE_PROD /
  NOTIFICATIONS / FULL_PIPELINE / AGENT_EXECUTIONS / DEPLOYMENT_RECORD smokes
  PASS, and the **new** DISPATCH / DISPATCH_TO_COMPLETED / PROGRESS_API /
  DEADLETTER smokes all PASS. The Redis groups list grew to include
  `orchestrator-workflow-group` on the four pipeline streams and a
  `deadletter-group` on `stream.deadletter`.
- **workflow_states query (recent):** `smoke-e2e-3896681` reached `completed`
  with `agent_progress` for all four downstream agents and
  `deployment_record_id`; `smoke-gw-prod` and `smoke-prod` stayed at
  `waiting_approval` with `dispatched: false`; `smoke-resume-3896681` reached
  `completed` (`resumed: true`, `dispatched: true`). No row records
  `production_executed: true`.
- **deployment_records correlation:** `smoke-e2e-3896681` /
  `smoke-pipeline-3896681` / `smoke-gw-dev` / `smoke-resume-3896681` /
  `smoke-persist-3896681` each have `environment=test`, `status=simulated`,
  and the `metadata` JSONB carries `task_id`, `workflow_id`, and
  `production_executed: false`. **No production deployment was performed and
  no Kubernetes / cloud / GitHub API was called.**
- **Issues & blockers:** none — all build, test, and verification steps
  passed on the first run; no fix commit was required.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The agents make no LLM / GitHub / Slack / Kubernetes / cloud calls; every
    artifact (`requirement_spec`, `code_change`, `test_report`,
    `deployment_record`) is a mock (`mock: true`). An approved
    `production.deploy` is dispatched to the agents which only simulate the
    deployment — `production_executed: false` everywhere.
  - The retry / dead-letter foundation re-publishes a failed message to the
    same input stream up to `max_retries` times before routing it to
    `stream.deadletter`; there is no separate retry scheduler or backoff.
    Poison messages can therefore loop fast — the bound is `max_retries`
    (default 3).
  - The orchestrator's workflow-event consumer correlates events by
    `task_id`. Tasks placed on `stream.tasks` directly by the gateway's
    `publish_to_stream: true` mode have no persisted workflow row; the
    consumer ignores them (no error).
  - PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Implement a proper retry scheduler / DLQ replayer that reads
     `stream.deadletter`, inspects failures, and either re-queues or surfaces
     them in an operator view.
  2. Add tracing / metrics across the orchestrator workflow, the agent
     pipeline, and the workflow-event consumer so the unified flow has a
     single timeline view.
  3. Add a workflow cancel / abort path so a queued workflow can be stopped
     before the agents pick it up.

## Stage 14 — Retry Scheduler, DLQ Replayer & Workflow Cancelation (Step 13)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-25 09:16–09:21 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `256f3fd`. Step 13 produces
  three commits:
  - `05a4e87982a119e7b9c56197eba52bc05e197dc1` — retry-scheduler service,
    DLQ replayer, orchestrator cancel/abort + ignore-after-abort,
    development-agent controlled failure, 5 new test files, 8 updated test
    files, runtime scripts, docker-compose, README.
  - `07f48f5` — smoke fix: cancel / abort smokes target `production.deploy`
    workflows so the cancel POST is not raced by the agent pipeline (the unit
    tests already covered the deterministic transitions against a seeded
    store).
  - this Stage 14 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `apps/retry-scheduler/{Dockerfile,requirements.txt,src/main.py,src/scheduler.py}`,
    `tests/{test_retry_scheduler.py,test_workflow_cancelation.py,test_workflow_abort.py,test_dlq_replay.py,test_failure_retry_flow.py}`
  - Modified: `apps/orchestrator/src/{main.py,workflow_events.py,progress.py}`,
    `shared/sdk/event_bus/redis_streams.py`,
    `shared/sdk/base_agent/stream_agent.py`,
    `agents/{requirement-agent,development-agent}/src/agent.py`,
    `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`,
    `scripts/{init_redis_streams.sh,check_runtime_state.sh}`,
    `tests/{conftest.py,test_deadletter_foundation.py}`,
    `README.md`, `source/progress.md`
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — retry / DLQ /
  cancel / abort / controlled-failure validation. **No production resources
  were created and no production deployment was executed.**
- **Retry scheduler result:** `apps/retry-scheduler/` runs as a 14th service
  on `127.0.0.1:8015` (`/health: ok`). It consumes `stream.deadletter` via
  the `retry-scheduler-group` consumer group and, for each event, sleeps
  `retry_after_seconds` (capped at 60s) before re-publishing the original
  event back to `original_stream` as `event: retry.requeued`. After the smoke
  run the `/status` endpoint reported
  `running: true, input_stream: stream.deadletter, group: retry-scheduler-group,
  requeued_count: 10, terminal_failure_count: 4`. No busy polling — the
  consume loop blocks on `XREADGROUP` and each scheduled requeue is an
  `asyncio.sleep`.
- **DLQ replay result:** `GET /deadletter` (paginated by `count`) returned
  five most-recent entries, each carrying the spec-aligned fields
  `original_stream`, `failure_reason`, `retry_count`, `max_retries`,
  `retry_after_seconds`, `failed_at`, and `original_event`.
  `POST /deadletter/replay/{message_id}` republished the entry as
  `event: retry.manual_replay` to the recorded `original_stream`
  (DLQ_REPLAY_SMOKE: `replayed=True stream=test.replay.smoke before=0
  after=2`). The terminal path
  (`retry_count > max_retries`) routes to `stream.deadletter.terminal` as
  `retry.terminal_failure` instead of requeueing.
- **Workflow cancel result:** `POST /workflow/cancel/{task_id}` on a
  `production.deploy` workflow at `waiting_approval` returned
  `{"stage": "canceled", "execution_result": {"status": "canceled",
  "cancel_reason": "runtime smoke", "production_executed": false, ...}}`.
  The persisted state JSONB carries `canceled_at` and `cancel_reason`. An
  already-terminal workflow (completed / canceled / aborted / rejected) is
  refused with 409 (`test_workflow_cancelation.py::test_cancel_completed_workflow_returns_409`).
  WORKFLOW_CANCEL_SMOKE: PASS.
- **Workflow abort result:** `POST /workflow/abort/{task_id}` returned the
  same shape with `stage: aborted`, `aborted_at`, `abort_reason: "runtime
  smoke abort"`, `production_executed: false`. WORKFLOW_ABORT_SMOKE: PASS.
- **Ignored event handling result:** the orchestrator's workflow-event
  consumer checks the workflow's current stage before applying an agent
  event; if the workflow is already `aborted` or `canceled` it skips the
  update, writes an `audit_logs` row
  (`decision_type: workflow_event_ignored`), and publishes a
  `workflow.event_ignored` notification.
  `tests/test_workflow_abort.py::test_workflow_event_consumer_ignores_events_for_aborted_workflow`
  and `..._canceled_workflow` cover both branches.
- **Failure simulation result:** the development-agent honors
  `request.simulate_failure: true` and raises a `SimulatedFailure` inside
  `handle()` — the consumer loop never crashes (the
  `_handle_failure` path retries and then dead-letters). End to end on the
  server: `smoke-fail-$$ → in-stream retries → DLQ (retry_count=3) → retry
  scheduler requeue → another failure (retry_count=4) → DLQ → terminal_failure
  (retry_count=4 > max_retries=3)`. FAILURE_SIMULATION_SMOKE:
  `dl_retry_count=4 terminal_retry_count=4 → PASS`.
- **Deadletter query:** `stream.deadletter xlen: 17`,
  `stream.deadletter.terminal xlen: 5`. A representative entry from
  `GET /deadletter` carries `task_id: smoke-fail-1733371`,
  `workflow_id: wf-smoke-fail-1733371`,
  `original_stream: stream.development`,
  `failure_reason: development-agent simulated failure for smoke-fail-1733371
  (request.simulate_failure)`, `retry_count: 4, max_retries: 3,
  retry_after_seconds: 1.0`, and the original retry.requeued payload
  embedded in `original_event`.
- **Docker compose ps:** 14 containers Up (healthy) — postgres, redis,
  vault, policy-engine, approval-engine, audit-service, orchestrator,
  communication-gateway, intake-agent, requirement-agent, development-agent,
  qa-agent, devops-agent, **retry-scheduler** — all bound to `127.0.0.1`.
- **Test results:** `run_tests.sh` on the server — `pytest` **153 passed**
  (26.56s, 0 skipped, 0 failures); `ruff check` all checks passed;
  `black --check` 83 files clean; `mypy shared/` no issues in 25 source
  files.
  - New pytest files: `test_retry_scheduler.py` (12 tests — 5 pure unit
    tests for `_is_terminal`, `_retry_delay`, `_original_stream`,
    `_build_requeue_event`, `_build_terminal_event` + 2 TestClient tests +
    5 Redis integration tests covering requeue, terminal, list);
    `test_workflow_cancelation.py` (4 tests — cancel, unknown 404,
    completed 409, default reason);
    `test_workflow_abort.py` (4 tests — abort, unknown 404,
    event-ignored-after-aborted, event-ignored-after-canceled);
    `test_dlq_replay.py` (4 tests — list endpoint shape, 404 path,
    integration replay, unknown KeyError);
    `test_failure_retry_flow.py` (3 tests — DLQ reached, terminal_failure
    reached, retry_count progression).
  - Locally (Windows, no infra): the same suite gives the same pure-unit /
    TestClient tests pass; redis/db/service tests skip. On the server the
    full suite is green.
- **Runtime smoke test:** `check_runtime_state.sh` on the server — 14
  containers Up; **all 22 smokes PASS** (HEALTH, NON_PROD, PROD_APPROVAL,
  governance HEALTH × 3, APPROVAL, AUDIT, WORKFLOW_PERSISTENCE,
  WORKFLOW_REPLAY, APPROVAL_RESUME, communication-gateway HEALTH,
  INTAKE_NONPROD, INTAKE_PROD, NOTIFICATIONS, 5× agent HEALTH +
  retry-scheduler HEALTH, FULL_PIPELINE, AGENT_EXECUTIONS,
  DEPLOYMENT_RECORD, DISPATCH, DISPATCH_TO_COMPLETED, PROGRESS_API,
  DEADLETTER, **DLQ_LIST**, **DLQ_REPLAY**, **WORKFLOW_CANCEL**,
  **WORKFLOW_ABORT**, **FAILURE_SIMULATION**). The Redis groups list now
  shows `retry-scheduler-group` on `stream.deadletter` and a separate
  `terminal-failure-group` on `stream.deadletter.terminal`.
- **source/progress.md latest:** this Stage 14 entry. The previous
  next-step suggestion to add a retry scheduler / DLQ replayer (Stage 13)
  and the suggestion to add a workflow cancel/abort path (Stage 13) are
  now implemented and validated.
- **Issues & blockers:** the initial smoke run hit a race in the cancel /
  abort smokes — the agent pipeline drove the `dev.test` workflow to
  `completed` before the smoke's POST arrived, so cancel / abort got 409.
  Fixed in commit `07f48f5` by switching the smoke to `production.deploy`
  (which stays at `waiting_approval` indefinitely). The unit tests under
  `test_workflow_cancelation.py` and `test_workflow_abort.py` were
  unaffected because they seed the workflow row directly.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The retry scheduler re-publishes to the original input stream
    immediately (within `retry_after_seconds`). A poison message that
    always fails will cycle through retries quickly until the scheduler
    publishes a `terminal_failure` event — work is bounded by
    `max_retries` but the system burns audit / notification / DLQ entries
    while iterating.
  - The terminal_failure event lives on its own stream
    (`stream.deadletter.terminal`) and is **not** yet consumed by the
    orchestrator. A failed workflow's `workflow_states.stage` therefore
    stays at `in_progress` (it never reaches a workflow-level `failed`
    state automatically). An operator can `POST /workflow/cancel` or
    `POST /workflow/abort` to bring it to a terminal stage.
  - The DLQ manual replay (`POST /deadletter/replay/{message_id}`) ignores
    `retry_count` — it republishes the original_event as
    `retry.manual_replay`. It is the operator's explicit recovery path; if
    the underlying defect is not yet fixed the replay will simply DLQ
    again.
  - Same as prior stages: no LLM / GitHub / Slack / Kubernetes / cloud
    calls; `production_executed: false` everywhere; PostgreSQL `trust`
    auth and Vault dev mode remain local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Surface terminal_failure events back into `workflow_states` — when the
     scheduler emits `retry.terminal_failure` for a `task_id` that owns a
     workflow row, transition that row to `stage: failed` so the workflow
     has a clear terminal state without operator intervention.
  2. Add exponential backoff to `retry_after_seconds` and / or a retry
     policy per agent so a flaky agent does not burn its retry budget
     instantly.
  3. Provide a `/workflow/replay/{task_id}` end-to-end path that pairs a
     workflow with a DLQ replay (find the most recent DLQ entry for the
     task, edit the payload, and replay).

## Stage 15 — Observability, Metrics & Distributed Tracing (Step 14)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-25 12:00–12:08 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `9b96dea`. Step 14 produces
  three commits:
  - `0d58f343b...` — observability SDK, tracing/metrics wiring in every
    service, workflow timeline, Prometheus + Grafana stack, four new test
    files.
  - `957016fa...` — runtime fix: tolerant grep on `/api/health` and
    GF_ANALYTICS_* env vars so Grafana stays offline (no grafana.com calls).
  - this Stage 15 progress entry is committed on top.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `shared/sdk/observability/{__init__.py,tracing.py,metrics.py,correlation.py}`,
    `apps/orchestrator/src/progress.py` updates,
    `infra/observability/{prometheus.yml,grafana/provisioning/datasources/prometheus.yml,grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yml,grafana/dashboards/aiagents.json}`,
    `tests/{test_metrics.py,test_tracing.py,test_observability_stack.py,test_workflow_timeline.py}`
  - Modified: every service's `requirements.txt` (`prometheus_client`,
    `opentelemetry-api`, `opentelemetry-sdk`), root `requirements.txt`
    (+ exporter + 3 instrumentation packages),
    every service's `main.py` (`setup_tracing(...)` +
    `install_metrics_endpoint(app)`),
    `shared/sdk/base_agent/stream_agent.py` (correlation_ids carries
    trace_id + emits agent metrics),
    `shared/sdk/event_bus/redis_streams.py` (DEADLETTER_TOTAL),
    `shared/sdk/notifications/client.py` (NOTIFICATION_TOTAL),
    `apps/orchestrator/src/{main.py,workflow.py,dispatch.py,workflow_events.py,resume_engine.py,progress.py}`,
    `apps/retry-scheduler/src/scheduler.py` (RETRY_TOTAL),
    `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` (+ prometheus + grafana),
    `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` (6 observability smokes),
    `tests/test_event_correlation.py` (correlation now 4 fields),
    `README.md`, `source/progress.md`
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — distributed tracing,
  Prometheus / Grafana, workflow timeline validation. **No production
  resources were created and no cloud observability SaaS was contacted.**
- **Tracing result:** every service initializes OpenTelemetry tracing at
  startup (`shared/sdk/observability/tracing.py::setup_tracing`).
  `inject_trace_context` / `extract_trace_context` carry a workflow-scope
  `trace_id` (128-bit hex) and a per-stage `span_id` (64-bit hex) through
  every Redis event. Without an OTLP collector configured the SDK keeps the
  ids local — no real cloud observability SaaS is contacted. The dispatch
  event now carries `task_id`, `workflow_id`, `trace_id`, `span_id`, and
  every agent's outbound message carries the same four fields
  (`StreamAgent.correlation_ids → correlation_payload`).
- **Metrics endpoint result:** every FastAPI service exposes
  `GET /metrics` in the Prometheus text format
  (`install_metrics_endpoint(app)`).
  Orchestrator `/metrics` smoke output starts with
  `# HELP workflow_total Workflows dispatched...` and `workflow_total{status="..."}`,
  followed by `workflow_completed_total`, `workflow_failed_total`,
  `workflow_duration_seconds_bucket{...}`, `agent_execution_total{...}`,
  `agent_latency_seconds_bucket{...}`, `deadletter_total{...}`,
  `retry_total{...}`, `notification_total{...}`. METRICS_ENDPOINT_SMOKE:
  PASS.
- **Prometheus scrape result:** prometheus 2.55.1 on
  `127.0.0.1:9090`. `/api/v1/targets` lists every service with
  `health=up` — orchestrator, policy-engine, approval-engine, audit-service,
  communication-gateway, intake-agent, requirement-agent, development-agent,
  qa-agent, devops-agent, retry-scheduler. PROMETHEUS_HEALTH: PASS,
  PROMETHEUS_TARGETS_SMOKE: PASS. `/api/v1/query?query=sum(workflow_total)`
  returns a value > 0 after the runtime smoke completes.
- **Grafana provisioning result:** grafana 11.3.0 on `127.0.0.1:3000`.
  Anonymous Admin access enabled for the local/test runtime. The
  AI Agents SWD Platform dashboard is auto-provisioned in the
  `AI Agents SWD` folder with 8 panels (workflow totals, failed by reason,
  deadletter total, agent execution rate, agent latency p95, workflow
  duration p95, retry / deadletter activity).
  GRAFANA_HEALTH: PASS (after the regex fix in commit `957016f`).
  All four GF_ANALYTICS_* env vars are now set to false so Grafana never
  contacts grafana.com.
- **Workflow timeline result:** `GET /workflow/progress/{task_id}` now also
  returns `traces` (`{trace_id, workflow_id}`), `agent_timeline`
  (chronological per-agent `started_at` / `completed_at` / `duration_ms`),
  and `retry_timeline` (DLQ entries observed for the task). The new
  `GET /workflow/timeline/{task_id}` returns the same timelines as a
  condensed view, suitable for a dashboard. WORKFLOW_TIMELINE_SMOKE: PASS
  on the smoke task `smoke-e2e-$$` after it completed through the agent
  pipeline.
- **Trace propagation result:** the smoke published a `task.created` event
  to `stream.tasks` with `trace_id=ff...ff` and verified the matching
  `devops.deployment_simulated` event on `stream.devops` carried both
  `trace_id=[0-9a-f]{32}` and a fresh `span_id=[0-9a-f]{16}` per hop.
  TRACE_PROPAGATION_SMOKE: PASS.
- **Docker compose ps:** 16 containers Up (healthy) — postgres, redis,
  vault, policy-engine, approval-engine, audit-service, orchestrator,
  communication-gateway, intake-agent, requirement-agent, development-agent,
  qa-agent, devops-agent, retry-scheduler, **prometheus**, **grafana** —
  all bound to `127.0.0.1`.
- **Test results:** `run_tests.sh` on the server — `pytest` **183 passed**
  (26.83s, 0 skipped, 0 failures); `ruff check` all checks passed;
  `black --check` 91 files clean; `mypy shared/` no issues in 29 source
  files.
  - New pytest files: `test_metrics.py` (5 tests — metric registry,
    counter / histogram observation, /metrics endpoint shape, install
    helper); `test_tracing.py` (9 tests — `setup_tracing` idempotency,
    `generate_trace_id` / `generate_span_id` format, inject / extract
    roundtrip, parent trace_id propagation, span_id refreshed per hop);
    `test_observability_stack.py` (9 tests — Prometheus config covers all
    11 services, Grafana provisioning files exist and reference
    `prometheus:9090`, dashboard JSON references all platform metrics,
    docker-compose binds 127.0.0.1:9090 and 127.0.0.1:3000, plus 3
    skip-guarded smoke tests against the live stack);
    `test_workflow_timeline.py` (8 tests — `build_agent_timeline` ordering
    + missing timestamps, `build_retry_timeline` skips invalid entries,
    API tests via `await workflow_progress` / `await workflow_timeline`).
  - Locally (Windows, no infra): 97 passed, 85 skipped, 0 failures. On the
    test server (full stack): 183 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failures.
- **Runtime smoke test:** `check_runtime_state.sh` — 16 containers Up; **all
  33 smokes PASS** including the existing 27 from Step 13 plus the new
  **PROMETHEUS_HEALTH**, **GRAFANA_HEALTH**, **PROMETHEUS_TARGETS_SMOKE**,
  **METRICS_ENDPOINT_SMOKE**, **TRACE_PROPAGATION_SMOKE**, and
  **WORKFLOW_TIMELINE_SMOKE**.
- **source/progress.md latest:** this Stage 15 entry. The previous Stage 13
  next-step suggestion to "add tracing / metrics across the orchestrator
  workflow, the agent pipeline, and the workflow-event consumer so the
  unified flow has a single timeline view" is now implemented and
  validated.
- **Issues & blockers:** the first verification run hit two non-blocking
  glitches that were fixed in commit `957016f`:
  1. `GRAFANA_HEALTH` smoke used a no-whitespace regex
     (`"database":"ok"`); Grafana returns `"database": "ok"`. Switched to
     a tolerant POSIX regex.
  2. Grafana 11.3.0 auto-pulled the `grafana-lokiexplore-app` plugin from
     grafana.com at startup. Disabled by `GF_ANALYTICS_REPORTING_ENABLED`,
     `GF_ANALYTICS_CHECK_FOR_UPDATES`,
     `GF_ANALYTICS_CHECK_FOR_PLUGIN_UPDATES`, and `GF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=""`
     — required by the "no real cloud observability SaaS" constraint.
  Both fixes were applied, pushed, and re-verified — all six observability
  smokes PASS.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The `OTLPSpanExporter` ships in `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp` (root
    requirements only) and is conditional on
    `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` being set. The local/test runtime does
    not set it, so traces are recorded in-process and dropped on flush —
    enough to validate id propagation, but not enough to view the
    distributed trace in a Tempo / Jaeger UI.
  - Grafana anonymous access (`GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED: true`) is
    appropriate only for the local/test environment — never for
    production.
  - Per-service instrumentation packages (`opentelemetry-instrumentation-{fastapi,redis,asyncpg}`)
    are in the root `requirements.txt` only. Service images install
    `opentelemetry-api` / `opentelemetry-sdk` / `prometheus_client`; the
    instrumentation packages are not yet wired into the FastAPI / Redis /
    asyncpg call sites — the present coverage is the custom trace_id
    propagation through Redis events and Prometheus counters / histograms.
  - Same as prior stages: no LLM / GitHub / Slack / Kubernetes / cloud
    calls; PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain
    local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. Add a Tempo / Jaeger sidecar to the compose stack and point
     `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at it so traces render as a span graph
     in Grafana's Tempo / Traces UI.
  2. Wire the instrumentation packages (FastAPI, Redis, asyncpg) into
     each service so per-request HTTP and per-XADD Redis spans are emitted
     automatically — currently only the manual workflow / agent spans
     exist.
  3. Add alert rules (`alerts.rules.yml`) targeting `workflow_failed_total
     > N` and `agent_execution_failures_total > M`; provision an
     Alertmanager so the same operator who runs `/workflow/cancel` sees
     a Grafana alert before the failure spreads.

## Stage 16.1 — Tempo Trace Backend (Step 15.1)

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-25 16:18–16:41 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; base commit `87aa313`. Step 15.1
  produces three commits:
  - `a3f936fa...` — Tempo service + Grafana Tempo datasource + OTEL_* env
    vars on every service + `verify_tracing_backend.sh` + tests + README.
  - `9725240...` — set exec bit on `scripts/verify_tracing_backend.sh`
    (Windows git did not carry the +x mode through the initial commit).
  - this Stage 16.1 progress entry.
- **Modified files:**
  - Added: `infra/observability/tempo/tempo.yml`,
    `infra/observability/grafana/provisioning/datasources/tempo.yml`,
    `scripts/verify_tracing_backend.sh`,
    `tests/test_tempo_config.py`,
    `tests/test_grafana_tempo_datasource.py`
  - Modified: `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` (tempo service +
    `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` /
    `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` on every service + grafana `depends_on tempo` +
    `tempo-data` volume),
    `infra/observability/grafana/provisioning/datasources/prometheus.yml`
    (`uid: prometheus` so the Tempo serviceMap can reference it),
    `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` (TEMPO_HEALTH +
    GRAFANA_TEMPO_DATASOURCE_SMOKE), `README.md`, `source/progress.md`.
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` — local Tempo trace backend
  validation. **No cloud observability SaaS, no Grafana Cloud, and no remote
  OTLP collector is contacted** (`tempo.yml::usage_report.reporting_enabled:
  false`).
- **Tempo container status:** `aiagents-test-tempo-1` running
  `grafana/tempo:2.6.1`; `Up 22 minutes (healthy)`; bound to
  `127.0.0.1:3200`, `127.0.0.1:4317`, `127.0.0.1:4318`. Local filesystem
  storage at `/var/tempo` backed by the `tempo-data` Docker volume.
- **Tempo `/ready` result:** `GET /ready → "ready"`;
  `GET /status/version` returned
  `tempo, version 2.6.1 (branch: HEAD, revision: 24c5b553d)`.
  TEMPO_READY: PASS, TEMPO_HEALTH: PASS.
- **Grafana Tempo datasource result:** `GET /api/datasources` returns two
  entries — `Prometheus` (`uid: prometheus`, `url: http://prometheus:9090`,
  `readOnly: true`) and `Tempo` (`type: tempo`, `url: http://tempo:3200`,
  `jsonData.serviceMap.datasourceUid: prometheus`,
  `jsonData.tracesToMetrics.datasourceUid: prometheus`, `readOnly: true`).
  GRAFANA_TEMPO_DATASOURCE_SMOKE: PASS,
  `test_grafana_serves_tempo_datasource_via_api`: PASS.
- **OTLP endpoint result:** all three Tempo ports listen on `127.0.0.1` —
  OTLP gRPC (`:4317`), OTLP HTTP (`:4318`), Tempo HTTP / query (`:3200`).
  A `POST http://localhost:4318/v1/traces` with an empty body returned
  `HTTP 200`, confirming the OTLP HTTP receiver accepts requests.
  OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT: PASS.
- **Per-service OTEL env vars:** every container (orchestrator,
  communication-gateway, policy-engine, approval-engine, audit-service, all
  five agents, retry-scheduler — 11 services total) carries
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://tempo:4317`,
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=<service-name>`.
  Verified by `docker compose exec -T orchestrator env | grep ^OTEL_`.
- **Test results:** `run_tests.sh` on the server — initial run
  `196 passed + 1 failed`; after force-recreating Grafana the failing
  `test_grafana_serves_tempo_datasource_via_api` flipped green, giving
  **197 passed in 27.54s** (0 skipped, 0 failures); `ruff check` all checks
  passed; `black --check` 93 files clean; `mypy shared/` no issues in 29
  source files.
  - New pytest files: `test_tempo_config.py` (9 tests — tempo.yml shape,
    OTLP gRPC/HTTP endpoints on 4317/4318, local storage paths,
    `usage_report` disabled, compose tempo service ports,
    grafana `depends_on tempo`, every service's OTEL env trio);
    `test_grafana_tempo_datasource.py` (5 tests — datasource type / URL /
    serviceMap UID + Prometheus UID + a live API test when grafana is up).
- **check_runtime_state.sh result:** all 33 prior smokes plus the new
  **TEMPO_HEALTH** and **GRAFANA_TEMPO_DATASOURCE_SMOKE** PASS. The runtime
  now has 17 healthy containers (postgres, redis, vault, policy-engine,
  approval-engine, audit-service, orchestrator, communication-gateway,
  intake-agent, requirement-agent, development-agent, qa-agent, devops-agent,
  retry-scheduler, prometheus, grafana, **tempo**).
- **Issues & blockers:** initial server run hit a Grafana datasource
  provisioning glitch — Docker Compose did not force-recreate the `grafana`
  container when `depends_on: + tempo` was the only change to its service
  block, so Grafana started before the new `tempo.yml` provisioning file
  was visible; the Prometheus datasource also stayed on its previously
  auto-generated UID instead of picking up the new `uid: prometheus`.
  `docker compose up -d --force-recreate grafana` re-ran provisioning and
  both datasources appeared correctly. After the fix the pytest suite went
  green and `GRAFANA_TEMPO_DATASOURCE_SMOKE` flipped from `CHECK` to
  `PASS`. The only code change needed for the fix was the
  `verify_tracing_backend.sh` exec-bit commit (`9725240`).
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The platform code still does not call `tracer.start_as_current_span(...)`
    anywhere, so no spans are actually exported to Tempo yet — the OTLP
    receivers are listening but the only traffic they see is the empty
    `POST /v1/traces` from `verify_tracing_backend.sh`. A follow-up step
    needs to install `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` per service
    and instrument the FastAPI handlers / Redis publishers so spans
    actually flow into Tempo.
  - The provisioning glitch above is hidden by
    `grafana-data:/var/lib/grafana` — Grafana's SQLite database persists
    across runs and provisioning runs only at startup. Changes to
    datasource provisioning files require either `--force-recreate
    grafana` or wiping the `grafana-data` volume.
  - Tempo's local filesystem backend uses the `tempo-data` volume; data
    survives container restarts. The `block_retention: 24h` setting keeps
    the volume bounded.
  - Same as prior stages: no cloud observability SaaS, no LLM / GitHub /
    Slack / Kubernetes / cloud calls; PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault
    dev mode remain local/test-only.
- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. **Wire actual span emission**: add
     `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc` (and the FastAPI / Redis /
     asyncpg instrumentation packages) to each service, then either call
     `FastAPIInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)` after `setup_tracing` or
     manually create spans around the orchestrator workflow nodes + each
     agent's `handle()`. Once spans flow, the Grafana Tempo datasource
     will surface them in the trace UI and the service map.
  2. **Bake `--force-recreate` into the deploy path** (or move dashboard /
     datasource provisioning behind `editable: true` plus a sentinel
     timestamp) so a `git pull && docker compose up -d` always picks up
     provisioning changes without manual intervention.
  3. **Add a `tempo` job to Prometheus** so Tempo's own metrics (block
     count, ingester rate, query duration) are scrapeable from the same
     observability stack.

## Stage 16.2 — Step 15.2: OpenTelemetry Auto-Instrumentation + Custom Workflow / Agent / Retry Spans

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-25 19:30 – 2026-05-26 11:55 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; deliverable commit `cee0719`,
  follow-up fix commits `ad9e497`, `6b53139`, `ad632d8`, `f545cb0`;
  Stage 16.2 progress record committed on top of `f545cb0`.
- **Modified files:**
  - `requirements.txt` — added `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-grpc`
    plus the four OTel instrumentation packages (fastapi, httpx, redis,
    asyncpg)
  - `apps/orchestrator/requirements.txt`,
    `apps/communication-gateway/requirements.txt`,
    `apps/policy-engine/requirements.txt`,
    `apps/approval-engine/requirements.txt`,
    `apps/audit-service/requirements.txt`,
    `apps/retry-scheduler/requirements.txt`,
    `agents/intake-agent/requirements.txt`,
    `agents/requirement-agent/requirements.txt`,
    `agents/development-agent/requirements.txt`,
    `agents/qa-agent/requirements.txt`,
    `agents/devops-agent/requirements.txt` — per-service OTel
    instrumentation deps (`-fastapi` everywhere, `-httpx` / `-redis` /
    `-asyncpg` where the service uses each library)
  - `shared/sdk/observability/tracing.py` — `instrument_fastapi`,
    `instrument_httpx`, `instrument_redis`, `instrument_asyncpg`,
    `instrument_all_clients` (idempotent, best-effort); `get_tracer`;
    `start_span(name, *, parent_trace_id, parent_span_id, **attrs)` with
    OTel-friendly attribute coercion and remote-parent-context support;
    `get_current_trace_id` helper; `_NoopTracer` / `_NoopSpan` fallback
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/main.py`,
    `apps/orchestrator/src/workflow.py`,
    `apps/orchestrator/src/workflow_events.py` — `setup_tracing` plus
    `instrument_fastapi(app, "orchestrator")`,
    `instrument_asyncpg / redis / httpx`; custom spans `workflow.run`,
    `workflow.policy_check`, `workflow.approval_request`,
    `workflow.audit`, `workflow.dispatch`, `workflow.event_update`,
    `workflow.completed`, `workflow.failed`; `_initial_state` adopts
    the active OTel trace_id so `/workflow/progress` and Tempo agree
  - `apps/communication-gateway/src/main.py`,
    `apps/policy-engine/src/main.py`,
    `apps/approval-engine/src/main.py`,
    `apps/audit-service/src/main.py`,
    `apps/retry-scheduler/src/main.py` — `instrument_fastapi` plus
    library-specific instrumentations during service startup
  - `apps/retry-scheduler/src/scheduler.py` — `retry.consume_deadletter`,
    `retry.requeue`, `retry.terminal_failure`, `retry.manual_replay`
    custom spans with `service.name / agent / task_id / workflow_id /
    stream / event_type / redis.message_id` attributes
  - `shared/sdk/base_agent/stream_agent.py` — `process()` reads
    `payload["trace_id"]` + `payload["span_id"]` and opens
    `agent.receive` as a remote-parented span so the downstream agent
    inherits the upstream trace_id; nested `agent.execute`,
    `agent.analyze`, `agent.write_audit`,
    `agent.publish_notification`; new `publish_next(message)` helper
    emits `agent.publish_next` and replaces direct
    `self.bus.publish_event` calls in every agent
  - `agents/intake-agent/src/main.py`,
    `agents/requirement-agent/src/main.py`,
    `agents/development-agent/src/main.py`,
    `agents/qa-agent/src/main.py`,
    `agents/devops-agent/src/main.py` — `setup_tracing` plus
    `instrument_*` calls during startup,
    `instrument_fastapi(app, name)`
  - `agents/intake-agent/src/agent.py`,
    `agents/requirement-agent/src/agent.py`,
    `agents/development-agent/src/agent.py`,
    `agents/qa-agent/src/agent.py`,
    `agents/devops-agent/src/agent.py` — call `self.publish_next` so
    every hand-off emits the `agent.publish_next` span; devops-agent
    wraps `deployment_records.insert` in a custom span
  - `shared/sdk/event_bus/redis_streams.py` — `publish_event`,
    `consume_events`, `consume_events_multi`, `ack_event` each emit a
    custom span carrying `redis.stream / redis.group /
    redis.consumer / redis.message_id / task_id / workflow_id /
    event_type / redis.batch_size / redis.operation`
  - `shared/sdk/workflow_store/store.py`,
    `shared/sdk/agent_execution/store.py` — custom asyncpg spans
    (`workflow_store.{create,update,get}`,
    `agent_execution.{create,complete,fail}`) layered on top of the
    auto-instrumented SQL spans
  - `shared/sdk/http_clients/policy_http_client.py`,
    `shared/sdk/http_clients/audit_http_client.py`,
    `shared/sdk/http_clients/approval_http_client.py` — new
    `task_id` / `workflow_id` kwargs plus custom `policy.evaluate`,
    `approval.{request,approve,reject,get}`,
    `audit.{record_event,get_events}` spans
  - `scripts/verify_trace_flow.sh` (new, +x in git index) — seeds a
    task through the gateway in orchestrator mode, polls
    `/workflow/progress/{task_id}` until completed, queries
    `GET http://tempo:3200/api/traces/<trace_id>`, asserts all seven
    `service.name` values appear, prints
    `TRACE_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS / FAIL / CHECK`
  - `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` — appended a `TRACE_FLOW_SMOKE`
    section calling the gateway in orchestrator mode and verifying
    the trace in Tempo; SIGPIPE-safe `head -c N || true`
  - `tests/test_auto_instrumentation.py` (new) — idempotency of
    `setup_tracing`, `instrument_fastapi`, `instrument_httpx`,
    `instrument_redis`, `instrument_asyncpg`; verifies the four OTel
    instrumentation packages and the OTLP gRPC exporter are importable
  - `tests/test_custom_spans.py` (new) — `start_span` is a working
    context manager, swallows attribute-coercion errors, propagates
    user exceptions; `inject_trace_context` keeps trace_id constant
    and assigns fresh span_ids per hop; greps each source file to
    assert every required custom span name is present in the workflow
    / agent / retry code
  - `tests/test_trace_flow.py` (new) — script exists, is +x in the
    git index, has valid bash syntax, targets the seven services,
    emits PASS / FAIL markers; live smoke runs `verify_trace_flow.sh`
    and asserts it reaches `VERIFY_TRACE_FLOW_DONE` when the stack is up
  - `tests/test_httpx_tracing.py` (new) — http clients accept
    `task_id` / `workflow_id` kwargs; live smoke calls
    `policy.evaluate` and `audit.record_event` under tracing when
    the services are up
  - `tests/test_redis_tracing.py` (new) — module imports succeed
    under best-effort OTel; live `publish_event` → `consume_events`
    → `ack_event` round-trip still works with spans wrapping every
    step; Tempo `/api/search` endpoint reachable
  - `README.md` — added the OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation /
    custom-span-hierarchy section, TraceQL examples for Grafana
    Explore, `verify_trace_flow.sh` usage
  - `source/progress.md` — this Stage 16.2 entry

- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` (`aiagent-swd`,
  Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS). Server pulled `f545cb0` via
  `git pull --ff-only`, rebuilt the eleven service images
  (`docker compose -f infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml build`),
  restarted the stack. All seventeen containers reach
  `Up … (healthy)`. No production resources were created. No
  production deploy was performed.

- **Test results (10.0.1.31, all from the venv):**

  | Check | Result |
  |-------|--------|
  | `pytest -q` (whole suite) | **227 passed, 1 warning** in 36.3s |
  | `ruff check .` | All checks passed |
  | `black --check .` | 98 files would be left unchanged |
  | `mypy shared/` | Success: no issues found in 29 source files |
  | `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` | 36 of 36 smokes **PASS**, including the new `TRACE_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS (7/7 services in trace …)` |
  | `scripts/verify_trace_flow.sh` | `TRACE_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS` — trace_id reaches Tempo with all seven expected `service.name` values |
  | `docker compose ps` | seventeen containers, every one `Up (healthy)` |

  **Auto-instrumentation coverage (verified against `/api/traces/<trace_id>` payloads):**

  | Layer | Coverage |
  |-------|----------|
  | FastAPI HTTP spans | `communication-gateway`, `orchestrator`, `policy-engine`, `approval-engine`, `audit-service`, `retry-scheduler`, `intake-agent`, `requirement-agent`, `development-agent`, `qa-agent`, `devops-agent` (all eleven services emit per-request spans) |
  | httpx client spans | orchestrator → policy-engine / approval-engine / audit-service; communication-gateway → orchestrator (W3C `traceparent` propagated automatically by the auto-instrumentation) |
  | Redis publish / consume / ack spans | every `RedisStreamEventBus.publish_event`, `consume_events`, `consume_events_multi`, `ack_event` call across all services |
  | asyncpg SQL spans | `workflow_store.{create,update,get}`, `agent_execution.{create,complete,fail}`, `deployment_records.insert` — plus per-statement spans from `AsyncPGInstrumentor` |
  | Custom workflow spans | `workflow.run`, `workflow.policy_check`, `workflow.approval_request`, `workflow.audit`, `workflow.dispatch`, `workflow.event_update`, `workflow.completed`, `workflow.failed` |
  | Custom agent spans | `agent.receive`, `agent.analyze`, `agent.execute`, `agent.publish_next`, `agent.write_audit`, `agent.publish_notification` (one set per agent stage) |
  | Custom retry spans | `retry.consume_deadletter`, `retry.requeue`, `retry.terminal_failure`, `retry.manual_replay` |

  **Tempo query result (`verify_trace_flow.sh`, run during this stage):**

  ```
  task_id=trace-verify-1779768241 workflow_id=wf-a444c05856c4
  trace_id=8be9f0fdeb1a2bb1ff9306684d2b758a final_stage=completed
    communication-gateway: PRESENT
    orchestrator:          PRESENT
    intake-agent:          PRESENT
    requirement-agent:     PRESENT
    development-agent:     PRESENT
    qa-agent:              PRESENT
    devops-agent:          PRESENT
  TRACE_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS (trace_id=8be9f0fdeb1a2bb1ff9306684d2b758a covers all 7 services)
  ```

  The `service.name` attribute in the Tempo trace covers every
  service the workflow touches. The trace_id reported by
  `/workflow/progress/{task_id}` matches the trace_id Tempo indexes
  the spans under (because `_initial_state` now adopts the active
  OTel trace_id).

- **Issues & blockers:** none — all assertions clear.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The agents inherit the upstream trace_id by building a remote
    `SpanContext` (`start_span(parent_trace_id=…, parent_span_id=…)`).
    This is a best-effort propagator — if a future upstream omits
    `trace_id` / `span_id` from the JSON event the agent simply starts
    a root span (no exception). The redis-py auto-instrumentation does
    NOT carry OTel context across stream messages; the in-payload
    `{trace_id, span_id}` block is the propagation channel.
  - `test_dlq_replay.py::test_manual_replay_publishes_back_to_original_stream`
    can flake when the running retry-scheduler container consumes the
    test's dead-letter entry before `sched.replay()` does — both
    publish to the same target stream and the test reads the most
    recent entry. Pre-existing flake unrelated to Step 15.2; passes
    on re-run.
  - The `head -c N` Tempo-response preview triggered `SIGPIPE`
    (exit 141) under `set -euo pipefail`. Documented in this stage;
    fixed with `|| true`. Worth keeping in mind for any future smoke
    that pipes a possibly-large response into `head`.
  - Same as prior stages: no real Slack / Discord / Telegram / GitHub
    / LLM / Kubernetes / cloud / Grafana Cloud calls; no secrets
    written; no production deploy; PostgreSQL `trust` auth and
    Vault dev mode remain local/test-only.

- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. **Wire W3C `traceparent` propagation on Redis publishes** so the
     `redis.publish` span and the downstream agent's `agent.receive`
     span are also linked directly through the OTel context (not only
     via the in-payload `trace_id / span_id` fields). This would let
     the service map in Grafana show the
     `redis.publish` → `agent.receive` edge automatically.
  2. **Add a Grafana TraceQL dashboard pane** (or a saved Explore
     link) that filters by `service.name = "orchestrator"` AND
     `name = "workflow.run"` so the trace UI surfaces workflow roots
     at a glance. Today the dashboard already references
     `workflow_total` / `workflow_completed` metrics; pairing them
     with a trace pane closes the metrics-→-trace pivot loop.
  3. **Tighten the dead-letter replay test** (`test_dlq_replay.py`)
     to either run the replay before the in-container retry-scheduler
     has a chance to requeue, or scan the target stream for the
     `retry.manual_replay` entry by event name rather than reading
     the newest entry. The current flake is harmless but adds noise
     to CI.

## Stage 16.3 — Step 15.3: Alertmanager + Prometheus Alert Rules

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-26 12:00 – 2026-05-26 13:10 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; deliverable commit `fdb1873`;
  Stage 16.3 progress record committed on top of `fdb1873`.
- **Modified files:**
  - `infra/observability/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml` (new) — route +
    null-receiver only; no `slack_configs / discord_configs /
    telegram_configs / pagerduty_configs / opsgenie_configs /
    webhook_configs / email_configs` block exists. Inhibit rule
    suppresses warning-severity noise when `AIServiceDown` is firing
    for the same component.
  - `infra/observability/prometheus/rules/aiagents.rules.yml` (new) —
    five rule groups (`aiagents.workflow`, `aiagents.agent`,
    `aiagents.retry`, `aiagents.platform`, `aiagents.approval`) holding
    eight alerts: `AIWorkflowFailuresHigh`, `AIWorkflowLatencyP95High`,
    `AIAgentExecutionFailuresHigh`, `AIDeadletterIncreasing`,
    `AIRetrySpike`, `AIServiceDown` (2m), `AIPrometheusTargetDown`
    (10m), `AIApprovalPendingTooLong` (placeholder until an
    `approval_pending_seconds` metric ships — expression
    `vector(0) > 1`, documented in a code comment). Each rule has
    `severity` + `component` labels and `summary` + `description` +
    `runbook_url` annotations.
  - `infra/observability/prometheus.yml` — added `rule_files:
    /etc/prometheus/rules/*.rules.yml` plus
    `alerting.alertmanagers: alertmanager:9093`. Existing scrape
    configs unchanged.
  - `infra/observability/grafana/provisioning/datasources/alertmanager.yml`
    (new) — Alertmanager datasource (`type: alertmanager`,
    `implementation: prometheus`, `uid: alertmanager`, points at
    `http://alertmanager:9093`).
  - `infra/observability/grafana/dashboards/aiagents.json` — dashboard
    bumped to `version: 2`, 13 panels: *Active alerts (firing)* stat,
    *Workflows dispatched / completed / failed* stats, *Service health*
    `up`-per-job table, *Active alerts over time* timeseries, the
    existing agent rate / agent p95 / workflow p95 / retry / dead-letter
    panels, plus *Retry totals (by kind)* and *Notifications total*.
    Every panel's Prometheus reference now uses `uid: prometheus`.
  - `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` — new `alertmanager`
    service (`prom/alertmanager:v0.27.0`, bound to `127.0.0.1:9093`,
    healthcheck `wget --spider /-/healthy`); `prometheus` now mounts
    `../observability/prometheus/rules:/etc/prometheus/rules:ro` and
    `depends_on: alertmanager`; `grafana` also `depends_on:
    alertmanager`; new named volume `alertmanager-data`.
  - `scripts/verify_alerting.sh` (new, +x in git index) — verifies
    `/-/healthy`, `/api/v2/status`, the eight required alert names via
    `/api/v1/rules`, `/api/v1/alerts`, `/api/v1/targets` (all up),
    and `/api/v2/receivers` (no slack / discord / telegram / pagerduty
    / opsgenie / webhook). Emits `ALERTMANAGER_HEALTHY /
    ALERTMANAGER_STATUS_API / PROMETHEUS_RULES_LOADED /
    PROMETHEUS_RULES_NAMES / PROMETHEUS_ALERTS_API /
    PROMETHEUS_TARGETS_ALL_UP / ALERTMANAGER_OFFHOST_RECEIVER` markers
    + `VERIFY_ALERTING_DONE`.
  - `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` — three new sections appended
    (`ALERTMANAGER_HEALTH`, `PROMETHEUS_RULES_SMOKE`,
    `PROMETHEUS_ALERTS_API_SMOKE`); existing 36 smokes unchanged.
  - `tests/test_prometheus_rules.py` (new) — rules file exists, YAML
    valid, every required alert name + label (`severity`,
    `component`) + annotation (`summary`, `description`,
    `runbook_url`) is present, every alert has an `expr`,
    `prometheus.yml` carries `rule_files` and `alerting.alertmanagers`
    pointing at `alertmanager:9093`.
  - `tests/test_alertmanager_config.py` (new) — YAML valid, route +
    receivers present, default route points at an existing receiver,
    no receiver declares any of the forbidden notifier blocks
    (`slack_configs`, …, `email_configs`), docker-compose includes
    the alertmanager service bound to `127.0.0.1:9093`, prometheus
    depends on alertmanager and mounts the rules directory.
  - `tests/test_alerting_endpoints.py` (new) — `verify_alerting.sh`
    exists, +x in git index, bash-syntax valid, exercises the right
    endpoints and emits the right markers; `check_runtime_state.sh`
    includes the three new alerting smokes; live tests (skipped when
    the stack is down) exercise Alertmanager `/-/healthy`,
    `/api/v2/status`, Prometheus rule loading + the eight alert
    names + `/api/v1/alerts`.
  - `README.md` — new *Alertmanager + Prometheus alert rules* section
    (table of the eight alerts, `verify_alerting.sh` description,
    null-receiver contract, "wiring a real notifier later" guidance
    via Vault); Alertmanager added to the observability stack table
    and the `infra/observability/` tree listing.
  - `source/progress.md` — this Stage 16.3 entry.

- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` (`aiagent-swd`,
  Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS). Server pulled `fdb1873` via
  `git pull --ff-only`, `docker compose -f
  infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up -d` added the new
  `alertmanager` container, and `docker compose up -d
  --force-recreate prometheus grafana alertmanager` re-ran Grafana's
  provisioning so the new Alertmanager datasource + updated dashboard
  were picked up. All eighteen containers reach `Up … (healthy)`.
  No production resources created; no production deploy performed.

- **Test results (10.0.1.31, all from the venv):**

  | Check | Result |
  |-------|--------|
  | `pytest -q` (whole suite) | **249 passed, 1 flaky failure** in 36.2s. The flake is `test_dlq_replay.py::test_manual_replay_publishes_back_to_original_stream`, a pre-existing race with the in-container retry-scheduler documented in Stage 16.2. Passes on isolated re-run (`pytest tests/test_dlq_replay.py -v` → 4 passed). |
  | `ruff check .` | All checks passed |
  | `black --check .` | 101 files unchanged |
  | `mypy shared/` | Success: no issues found in 29 source files |
  | `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` | **39 / 39 smokes PASS**, including the new `ALERTMANAGER_HEALTH`, `PROMETHEUS_RULES_SMOKE`, `PROMETHEUS_ALERTS_API_SMOKE`. `TRACE_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS (7/7 services)` continues to pass on top. |
  | `scripts/verify_alerting.sh` | `VERIFY_ALERTING_DONE` reached; every assertion PASS. |
  | `docker compose ps` | eighteen containers, every one `Up (healthy)` (alertmanager joined the seventeen-container stack from Stage 16.2). |

  **Alertmanager status:**
  ```
  /-/healthy           -> HTTP 200
  /api/v2/status       -> cluster.status=ready, versionInfo present
  /api/v2/receivers    -> [{"name":"null-receiver"}]
  ```

  **Prometheus rules loaded (`/api/v1/rules`):**
  ```
  aiagents.* rule groups found: 5
   - aiagents.workflow   (AIWorkflowFailuresHigh, AIWorkflowLatencyP95High)
   - aiagents.agent      (AIAgentExecutionFailuresHigh)
   - aiagents.retry      (AIDeadletterIncreasing, AIRetrySpike)
   - aiagents.platform   (AIServiceDown, AIPrometheusTargetDown)
   - aiagents.approval   (AIApprovalPendingTooLong, placeholder)
  ```

  **Prometheus alerts API (`/api/v1/alerts`):**
  ```
  {"status":"success","data":{"alerts":[]}}
  ```
  No alerts firing under nominal traffic — expected. All eleven
  service targets are `up`, so neither `AIServiceDown` nor
  `AIPrometheusTargetDown` triggers; no recent failures means
  `AIWorkflowFailuresHigh`, `AIAgentExecutionFailuresHigh`,
  `AIDeadletterIncreasing`, `AIRetrySpike` stay inactive; workflow
  p95 well below 30s so `AIWorkflowLatencyP95High` is inactive.
  `AIApprovalPendingTooLong` is a placeholder rule that cannot fire
  by design.

  **Grafana dashboard:**
  ```
  Dashboard:  AI Agents SWD Platform (uid: aiagents-platform), version 2
  Panel count: 13
    - Active alerts (firing)                  [stat, ALERTS{alertstate="firing"}]
    - Workflows dispatched / completed / failed-canceled-aborted
    - Service health (up per job)             [table, up]
    - Active alerts over time                 [timeseries]
    - Agent execution rate (per agent)        [timeseries]
    - Agent latency p95 (seconds)             [timeseries]
    - Workflow duration p95 (seconds)         [timeseries]
    - Retry / deadletter activity             [timeseries]
    - Dead-letter total                       [stat]
    - Retry totals (by kind)                  [stat]
    - Notifications total (by event_type)     [stat]
  Datasources visible to Grafana: Prometheus (default), Tempo, Alertmanager
  ```

- **Issues & blockers:** none — every assertion clears.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The `AIApprovalPendingTooLong` rule is intentionally a placeholder:
    no `approval_pending_seconds` (or `approval_pending_total`) metric
    is emitted yet. The expression `vector(0) > 1` is always false so
    the rule loads cleanly and shows up in `/api/v1/rules` without
    falsely alerting. The TODO comment in the rule file marks the
    follow-up.
  - Alertmanager runs in single-node clustered mode (default).
    `cluster.peers[0]` self-references the same container — this is
    correct for one-node mode.
  - When Grafana is recreated without `--force-recreate`, the
    provisioned Alertmanager datasource and the dashboard `version:
    2` may be served stale from the persistent `grafana-data` volume.
    We run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate prometheus grafana
    alertmanager` after pulling, which forces re-provisioning.
    Documented in Stage 16.1; still the supported deploy step.
  - Same as prior stages: no real Slack / Discord / Telegram /
    PagerDuty / OpsGenie / webhook / Grafana Cloud / observability
    SaaS call; no secret or token written; no production deploy;
    PostgreSQL `trust` auth and Vault dev mode remain
    local/test-only.

- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. **Emit `approval_pending_seconds`** from the approval-engine
     (Histogram, labelled `risk_level`) so
     `AIApprovalPendingTooLong` can have a real expression — e.g.
     `histogram_quantile(0.95,
     rate(approval_pending_seconds_bucket[1h])) > 3600`. Once that
     ships, swap the placeholder expression in `aiagents.rules.yml`
     and tighten the test.
  2. **Wire alert firing into the workflow timeline UI.** The
     orchestrator's `/workflow/timeline/{task_id}` already exposes
     a per-workflow timeline; pulling the matching firing alerts
     (by `task_id` or `workflow_id` labels — those aren't on `up`
     today, but could be on `agent_execution_failures_total` and
     `workflow_failed_total`) would close the metric-→-incident
     loop in one API call.
  3. **Add an Alertmanager dead-man's-switch** (`AIDeadMansSwitch`
     alert that is always firing) routed through a separate
     "watchdog" receiver. Today the null receiver silently absorbs
     alerts — a watchdog would let an external auditor confirm
     Prometheus + Alertmanager are actually evaluating. The
     watchdog receiver still must not contact any real off-host
     notifier; it could write to a stream or to stdout.

## Stage 16.4 — Step 15.4: SLO / Incident API Foundation

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-26 13:30 – 2026-05-26 14:50 (UTC+8, Asia/Taipei)
- **Git branch / commit:** branch `main`; deliverable commit `cc10431`;
  Stage 16.4 progress record committed on top of `cc10431`.
- **Modified files:**
  - `migrations/005_incident_management.sql` (new) — strictly additive,
    idempotent: adds `task_id`, `workflow_id`, `source NOT NULL DEFAULT
    'unknown'`, `details JSONB`, `acknowledged_at`, `resolved_at` to
    `incident_records`; creates five indexes (`status`, `severity`,
    `task_id`, `workflow_id`, `created_at`). Re-running the migration
    only emits `NOTICE: ... already exists, skipping`; no rows are
    rewritten.
  - `shared/sdk/incidents/__init__.py`, `models.py`, `store.py` (new) —
    `Incident` dataclass + `INCIDENT_SEVERITIES = (sev1..sev4)` +
    `INCIDENT_STATUSES = (open, acknowledged, resolved)`;
    `normalize_severity`, `normalize_status` clamp unknown inputs to
    `sev3` / `open`. `IncidentStore` exposes
    `create_incident / get_incident / list_incidents / ack_incident /
    resolve_incident`; transitions are idempotent (`COALESCE` on
    `acknowledged_at` / `resolved_at`); every call emits a custom
    `incident_store.{create,get,list,transition}` OTel span on top of
    the asyncpg auto-instrumentation.
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/incidents_api.py` (new) — pure helpers
    (`create_incident_with_side_effects`,
    `ack_incident_with_side_effects`,
    `resolve_incident_with_side_effects`) so the side-effects
    (notification + audit) are testable in isolation. Audit + notification
    failures are swallowed with `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` so the
    primary store write decides the API outcome.
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/main.py` — five new routes:
    `GET /incidents` (filters: `status`, `severity`, `task_id`,
    `workflow_id`), `GET /incidents/{incident_id}`, `POST /incidents`,
    `POST /incidents/{incident_id}/ack`,
    `POST /incidents/{incident_id}/resolve`. `summary` is required;
    `severity` defaults to `sev3`; `source` defaults to `operator`.
    Each POST emits `incident.created` / `incident.acknowledged` /
    `incident.resolved` notifications on `stream.notifications` and
    `decision_type=incident_created` / `_acknowledged` / `_resolved`
    audit events via audit-service.
  - `apps/retry-scheduler/src/scheduler.py` — `RetryScheduler.handle`
    now calls `_on_terminal_failure` whenever
    `retry_count > max_retries`. That method (best-effort, never
    crashes the consumer):
    1. flips `workflow_states.stage` to `failed` via
       `_mark_workflow_failed`, leaving an already-terminal workflow
       alone (completed / canceled / aborted / failed / rejected);
    2. creates an `incident_records` row (severity `sev2`, source
       `retry-scheduler`, summary
       "terminal failure: max retries exceeded …", details
       JSONB with `original_stream`, `retry_count`, `max_retries`,
       `failure_reason`, `failed_at`, `original_event`,
       `original_message_id`; `workflow_not_found: true` when there is
       no workflow row);
    3. publishes a `workflow.failed` notification keyed by `task_id`;
    4. writes an audit event `decision_type='workflow_failed'`;
    5. increments `WORKFLOW_FAILED_TOTAL{reason='failed'}`.
    Returns the `incident_id` on the scheduler's result dict.
  - `apps/retry-scheduler/requirements.txt` — adds `httpx`, `asyncpg`,
    `opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx`,
    `opentelemetry-instrumentation-asyncpg` (needed for the new
    audit-service + IncidentStore + WorkflowStore calls).
  - `apps/retry-scheduler/src/main.py` — `instrument_asyncpg` +
    `instrument_httpx` during startup.
  - `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` — retry-scheduler gains
    `DATABASE_URL` + `AUDIT_SERVICE_URL` env vars and
    `depends_on: postgres healthy` so the new asyncpg / audit calls
    work the moment the container starts.
  - `infra/observability/slo/aiagents-slo.yml` (new) — 6 SLOs:
    `workflow_completion_p95_seconds` (≤30s/5m, active),
    `workflow_success_rate` (≥95%/15m, active),
    `agent_failure_rate` (≤5%/5m, active),
    `dlq_growth_rate` (≤5/5m, active),
    `approval_pending_duration_seconds` (≤3600s/1h, **status: planned**
    with `todo` + `vector(0)` placeholder; tracked alongside the
    matching `AIApprovalPendingTooLong` Prometheus alert),
    `service_availability` (≥99%/5m, active). Every SLO carries
    `name`, `description`, `target`, `window`, `query`, `severity`,
    `owner`, `runbook_url`.
  - `scripts/verify_incident_flow.sh` (new, +x in git index) — seeds
    a `simulate_failure: true` workflow, polls
    `/incidents?task_id=...` until the incident appears, then asserts:
    workflow `stage=failed`, `workflow.failed` notification on
    `stream.notifications`, `decision_type=workflow_failed` in
    audit-service, `/incidents/{id}/ack` returns
    `status=acknowledged`, `/incidents/{id}/resolve` returns
    `status=resolved`. Six checks aggregate into
    `INCIDENT_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS|CHECK|FAIL` plus a
    `VERIFY_INCIDENT_FLOW_DONE` marker.
  - `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` — appends seven smokes:
    `INCIDENT_API_SMOKE`, `INCIDENT_CREATE_SMOKE`,
    `INCIDENT_ACK_SMOKE`, `INCIDENT_RESOLVE_SMOKE`,
    `TERMINAL_FAILURE_INCIDENT_SMOKE`, `WORKFLOW_FAILED_STATE_SMOKE`,
    `SLO_CONFIG_SMOKE`.
  - `tests/test_incident_store.py` (new) — severity / status
    normalization unit tests + skip-guarded asyncpg integration tests
    for create/get/list, ack-then-resolve (with ack timestamp
    preservation), filter-by-severity, unknown-severity normalization.
  - `tests/test_incident_api.py` (new) — TestClient against
    `main.app`: GET list contract (200 or 503, never 500), POST
    summary-required (400), POST details-must-be-object (400),
    skip-guarded DB integration covering create → get → list → ack →
    resolve, unknown-id returns 404/503, severity filter respects the
    column, and (when audit-service is live) an `incident_created`
    audit event lands within 5s.
  - `tests/test_terminal_failure_incident.py` (new) — direct
    `RetryScheduler.handle` tests with the live Redis + Postgres
    runtime: terminal-failure creates the incident + flips the
    workflow to `failed`; orphan task_id still creates the incident
    with `details.workflow_not_found=true`; `workflow.failed`
    notification lands on `stream.notifications`; when audit-service
    is up the `workflow_failed` audit event is also written.
  - `tests/test_slo_config.py` (new) — YAML valid + every required
    SLO + every required field + planned SLOs must declare `todo` +
    `vector(...)` placeholder, active SLOs must reference at least
    one metric name actually exported by
    `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py`; also asserts the verify
    script + check_runtime_state.sh wire the right markers and that
    migration 005 uses idempotent `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` /
    `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`.
  - `tests/test_dlq_replay.py` — fix the pre-existing flake noted in
    Stage 16.2 / 16.3: scan the target stream for the
    `event=retry.manual_replay` entry instead of reading the newest
    entry (the running retry-scheduler container races us). Test now
    passes deterministically.
  - `README.md` — Incident API table, terminal-failure → incident
    flow, SLO table (incl. `status: planned` discipline),
    `verify_incident_flow.sh` usage, Alertmanager remains null receiver.
  - `source/progress.md` — this Stage 16.4 entry.

- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31` (`aiagent-swd`,
  Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS). Server pulled `cc10431` via
  `git pull --ff-only`. Migration 005 was applied via
  `psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 < migrations/005_incident_management.sql`
  twice — the second run only emitted
  `NOTICE: ... already exists, skipping` (idempotency confirmed). The
  `incident_records` table now has the eleven expected columns + five
  indexes. `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml
  build orchestrator retry-scheduler` rebuilt both images,
  `docker compose up -d orchestrator retry-scheduler` rolled them, and
  `docker compose up -d --force-recreate prometheus grafana
  alertmanager` re-ran provisioning per the Stage 16.1 deploy step.
  All eighteen containers reach `Up … (healthy)`. No production
  resources created; no production deploy performed.

- **Test results (10.0.1.31, all from the venv):**

  | Check | Result |
  |-------|--------|
  | `pytest -q` (whole suite) | **280 passed, 0 failed**, 1 warning in 36.9s. The Stage 16.2 / 16.3 `test_dlq_replay` flake is gone (the test now scans the target stream by `event_type`). |
  | `ruff check .` | All checks passed |
  | `black --check .` | 109 files unchanged |
  | `mypy shared/` | Success: no issues found in 32 source files |
  | `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` | **46 / 46 smokes PASS**, including the seven new incident smokes (`INCIDENT_API_SMOKE`, `INCIDENT_CREATE_SMOKE`, `INCIDENT_ACK_SMOKE`, `INCIDENT_RESOLVE_SMOKE`, `TERMINAL_FAILURE_INCIDENT_SMOKE`, `WORKFLOW_FAILED_STATE_SMOKE`, `SLO_CONFIG_SMOKE`). `TRACE_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS (7/7 services)` continues to pass. |
  | `scripts/verify_incident_flow.sh` | `INCIDENT_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS` — 6/6 checks; `VERIFY_INCIDENT_FLOW_DONE` reached. |
  | `docker compose ps` | eighteen containers, every one `Up (healthy)`. |

  **Incident store / API result:**
  ```
  $ curl -sS http://localhost:8000/incidents | head -c 200
  {"count": N, "incidents": [...]}

  $ curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8000/incidents -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"summary":"smoke","source":"operator","severity":"sev3"}'
  -> {"incident_id":"<uuid>","status":"open","severity":"sev3","source":"operator",...}

  $ curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8000/incidents/<uuid>/ack
  -> {"status":"acknowledged","acknowledged_at":"<iso>","..."}

  $ curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8000/incidents/<uuid>/resolve
  -> {"status":"resolved","resolved_at":"<iso>","acknowledged_at":"<earlier iso>",...}
  ```
  Filters (`?status=`, `?severity=`, `?task_id=`, `?workflow_id=`) all
  honoured by `IncidentStore.list_incidents`.

  **Terminal failure → incident → workflow.failed (verify_incident_flow.sh excerpt):**
  ```
  task_id=incident-verify-1779777448
  incident_id=c9318957-2bbb-47a1-a258-4a76a47f6681 incident_status=open

  workflow stage=failed: PRESENT
  workflow.failed notification: PRESENT
  audit decision_type=workflow_failed: PRESENT
  incident ack: PASS
  incident resolve: PASS

  checks passed: 6 / 6
  INCIDENT_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS
  ```
  The retry-scheduler observed the `simulate_failure` workflow
  exhaust its retries, wrote the `sev2` incident, flipped
  `workflow_states.stage` to `failed`, published the
  `workflow.failed` notification, and recorded the
  `workflow_failed` audit event automatically — no operator
  intervention needed.

  **SLO config result:** `aiagents-slo.yml` parses; 6 SLOs declared,
  the `approval_pending_duration_seconds` SLO is explicitly
  `status: planned` with a `todo` field (paired with the placeholder
  `AIApprovalPendingTooLong` alert). The active SLOs reference the
  metric names already emitted by
  `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py` plus the Prometheus built-in
  `up`. The runtime smoke only validates the file shape:
  `SLO_CONFIG_SMOKE: PASS`.

  **Flaky DLQ test fix:** `test_dlq_replay.py
  ::test_manual_replay_publishes_back_to_original_stream` now scans
  the target stream with `xrange(target, '-', '+')` and filters for
  `event == retry.manual_replay`, so the live retry-scheduler
  container can publish a regular `retry.requeued` to the same target
  without flipping the assertion. Pre-existing race noted in Stage
  16.2 / 16.3 is closed.

- **Issues & blockers:** none — every assertion clears.
- **Risks / notes:**
  - The retry-scheduler now writes to PostgreSQL (`incident_records` +
    `workflow_states`) and HTTP-calls audit-service. Every side-effect
    is wrapped in `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` and the original
    terminal-failure publish to `stream.deadletter.terminal` happens
    first, so an outage in any one of those targets cannot prevent
    the dead-letter from being terminal-marked or stop the consumer
    loop.
  - `incident_records.id` is `UUID` (from the original `001`
    migration); the IncidentStore + API expose it as `incident_id`
    (string). Bogus / non-UUID inputs to `/incidents/{id}` return 404
    or 503 — never 500 — because the SDK catches `asyncpg.PostgresError`
    + `ValueError` from `$1::uuid` casts.
  - The `approval_pending_duration_seconds` SLO and the
    `AIApprovalPendingTooLong` Prometheus alert are both placeholders
    pending the approval-engine emitting `approval_pending_seconds`.
    Documented in this stage and in `aiagents-slo.yml`'s `todo`
    field; the SLO test enforces that any `status: planned` SLO must
    carry the `todo` + a `vector(...)` placeholder query.
  - Same as prior stages: no real Slack / Discord / Telegram /
    PagerDuty / GitHub / LLM / Kubernetes / cloud / Grafana Cloud /
    observability SaaS call; no secret or token written; no
    production deploy; PostgreSQL `trust` auth + Vault dev mode
    remain local/test only.

- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. **Wire the alert-firing UI/API** — Alertmanager already exposes
     firing alerts on `/api/v2/alerts`; the orchestrator could poll
     that and auto-create matching `incident_records` rows (severity
     mapped from alert label). Today an operator has to call
     `POST /incidents` themselves when an alert fires. With auto-
     promotion, a `AIWorkflowFailuresHigh` alert would land as an
     incident the same way the retry-scheduler terminal failure does
     now.
  2. **Emit `approval_pending_seconds`** from approval-engine
     (`Histogram`, labelled `risk_level`) so the placeholder SLO +
     alert can be flipped to real `histogram_quantile` expressions.
     Once that ships, also update `aiagents-slo.yml` to drop
     `status: planned` and remove the `todo` field, plus the
     `test_slo_config.py::test_planned_slos_must_declare_a_todo`
     guard still applies to anything new.
  3. **Add an `/incidents/{id}/audit-trail` endpoint** that joins
     `audit_logs` rows tagged with `incident_id` (we already write
     `artifact_refs={"incident_id": ...}` on ack / resolve). That
     would give operators a single-call view of who acked / resolved
     an incident without joining tables themselves.


## Stage 16.5 — Step 15.5: Full Verification & Operational Readiness

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-26 17:30–18:10 (local)
- **Git branch / commit:**
  `main` →
  Commit A `07f2acc Step 15.5: full verification + operational readiness`
  Commit B (this entry) appended on top.
- **Previous commit:** `d89a9cd Stage 16.4: progress log - Step 15.4
  SLO/Incident API foundation + 10.0.1.31 validation`.
- **Deployment target:** local/test runtime on 10.0.1.31 only — no
  production deploy, no real Slack / Discord / Telegram / PagerDuty /
  webhook call, no real GitHub / Kubernetes / Cloud / LLM API, no
  secret/token written.

- **Modified / added files:**
  - `scripts/verify_platform_observability.sh` — new aggregate
    verification script (`+x` in git index, validated by
    `bash -n`). 12 inline sections covering Docker / health /
    metrics / Prometheus / Grafana / Tempo / Alertmanager /
    workflow / trace / incident / SLO / safety, plus a 13th section
    that runs the 5 existing `verify_*.sh` scripts as sub-steps and
    reports each as `PASS / FAIL`. Final aggregate line:
    `PLATFORM_OBSERVABILITY_VERIFY: PASS`. Also prints the per-area
    pass markers required by the spec:
    `CHECK_RUNTIME_STATE: PASS`, `VERIFY_TRACING_BACKEND: PASS`,
    `VERIFY_TRACE_FLOW: PASS`, `VERIFY_ALERTING: PASS`,
    `VERIFY_INCIDENT_FLOW: PASS`.
  - `docs/operations/observability-runbook.md` — new operator
    runbook (~280 lines): platform service map with ports, how to
    check Docker / Prometheus / Grafana / Tempo, how to find a
    workflow by `task_id`, query a `trace_id` against Tempo, list
    and replay the DLQ, list / ack / resolve incidents, confirm
    terminal-failure → incident flow, confirm `production_executed
    = false`, plus common-issue troubleshooting (Grafana
    provisioning force-recreate, Tempo trace-not-found, Prometheus
    target down, DLQ replay race, Postgres trust auth + Vault dev
    mode reminder). Closes with a verification-script cheat sheet.
  - `docs/operations/manual-verification.md` — new copy-paste
    checklist for a human operator on 10.0.1.31: 18 numbered
    steps from `ssh aiagent-swd` through running every verify
    script, building a workflow, querying its trace in Tempo,
    driving an incident lifecycle, and confirming
    `deployment_records` has zero `production_executed=true` rows.
    Ends with a sign-off checklist.
  - `README.md` — new **Operational Readiness** section linking
    the runbook + manual verification + aggregate verification
    script, restating the local/test contract: null Alertmanager
    receiver, mock deployments only, `production_executed = false`
    safety probe.
  - `tests/test_platform_observability_script.py` — 8 static
    checks: file exists, +x in git index, `bash -n` clean,
    aggregate markers present, all 5 sub-scripts referenced, every
    required area covered (Docker / health / metrics / Prometheus /
    Alertmanager / Grafana / Tempo / workflow / incident / SLO /
    safety), no external SaaS hostnames, no embedded secret tokens.
  - `tests/test_operational_runbook.py` — 7 static checks: file
    exists, required sections + phrases present, verification
    scripts mentioned, safety contract documented, banned production
    deploy commands absent, no secret tokens, references both
    10.0.1.31 and localhost / 127.0.0.1.
  - `tests/test_manual_verification_doc.py` — 7 static checks:
    file exists, required copy-paste commands present, test server
    + repo path mentioned, safety contract documented, banned
    production deploy commands absent, no secret tokens, README
    cross-references both new docs + the aggregate script.

- **Test results (Windows dev box, no Docker runtime):**
  - `pytest`: **193 passed, 109 skipped** (skips are runtime-gated
    integration tests requiring Redis / Postgres / docker — they
    run on the test server, not Windows).
  - `ruff check .`: clean.
  - `black --check .`: 112 files unchanged.
  - `mypy shared/`: 32 source files, no issues.

- **Test results (10.0.1.31, after `docker compose build && up -d
  && up -d --force-recreate prometheus grafana alertmanager tempo`):**
  - 18 / 18 containers reported `running (healthy)`.
  - `pytest -q` inside `.venv`: **302 passed, 1 warning** in 37.20s
    (the deprecation warning is pre-existing —
    `asyncio.get_event_loop()` in `test_redis_tracing.py:22`).
  - `ruff check .`: clean.
  - `black --check .`: 112 files unchanged.
  - `mypy shared/`: 32 source files, no issues.
  - `./scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`: every named smoke `PASS`
    (workflow / approval / agents / DLQ / failure-simulation /
    Tempo / Prometheus / Alertmanager / Grafana / incidents / SLO
    / trace-flow), ends `CHECK_RUNTIME_STATE_DONE`. Note: the
    inline Python smokes (`TRACE_PROPAGATION_SMOKE`,
    `DEADLETTER_SMOKE`, `DLQ_REPLAY_SMOKE`, `FAILURE_SIMULATION_SMOKE`)
    use the system `python3 -`; they only PASS when the SSH session
    has the project `.venv` activated (so `shared/` is on the
    `PYTHONPATH`). Documented in the runbook.
  - `./scripts/verify_tracing_backend.sh`: `TEMPO_READY: PASS`,
    `OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT: PASS`, `GRAFANA_TEMPO_DATASOURCE: PASS`,
    `VERIFY_TRACING_BACKEND_DONE`.
  - `./scripts/verify_trace_flow.sh`:
    `TRACE_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS (trace_id=1e25f031d5c0432fe72c6ce60836588f
    covers all 7 services)`, `VERIFY_TRACE_FLOW_DONE`.
  - `./scripts/verify_alerting.sh`: `ALERTMANAGER_HEALTHY: PASS`,
    `PROMETHEUS_RULES_LOADED: PASS (5 groups)`,
    `PROMETHEUS_RULES_NAMES: PASS` (all 8 alerts present),
    `PROMETHEUS_TARGETS_ALL_UP: PASS (up=11 down=0)`,
    `ALERTMANAGER_OFFHOST_RECEIVER: PASS (null receiver only)`,
    `VERIFY_ALERTING_DONE`.
  - `./scripts/verify_incident_flow.sh`: `checks passed: 6 / 6`,
    `INCIDENT_FLOW_SMOKE: PASS`, `VERIFY_INCIDENT_FLOW_DONE`.
  - `./scripts/verify_platform_observability.sh`: **PASS=81  FAIL=0**.
    Aggregate output:

    ```
    CHECK_RUNTIME_STATE: PASS
    VERIFY_TRACING_BACKEND: PASS
    VERIFY_TRACE_FLOW: PASS
    VERIFY_ALERTING: PASS
    VERIFY_INCIDENT_FLOW: PASS
    PLATFORM_OBSERVABILITY_VERIFY: PASS
    VERIFY_PLATFORM_OBSERVABILITY_DONE
    ```

    Per-area PASS counts (excerpted):
    - 18 / 18 `container.*` PASS.
    - 11 / 11 `health.*` PASS (HTTP 200 each).
    - 3 / 3 `metrics.*` PASS (orchestrator `workflow_total`,
      5/5 agents emit `agent_execution_total`, retry-scheduler
      emits `retry_total` / `deadletter_total`).
    - 4 / 4 `prometheus.*` PASS (healthy / targets all up /
      5 `aiagents.*` rule groups / alerts API success).
    - 5 / 5 `grafana.*` PASS (api health, prometheus + tempo +
      alertmanager datasources, `AI Agents SWD Platform` dashboard).
    - 2 / 2 `tempo.*` PASS.
    - 3 / 3 `alertmanager.*` PASS (`null receiver only`).
    - 7 / 7 `workflow.*` and 8 / 8 `trace.*` PASS — the
      end-to-end workflow reached `completed`, every agent appeared
      in the timeline, the trace ID was queryable in Tempo with
      spans for `communication-gateway / orchestrator / intake-agent
      / requirement-agent / development-agent / qa-agent /
      devops-agent`.
    - 4 / 4 `incident.*` PASS (terminal failure → incident →
      `workflow_states.stage = failed` → ack → resolve).
    - 8 / 8 `slo.*` PASS (YAML parses; every required SLO entry
      present; `status: planned` carries `todo`).
    - 2 / 2 `safety.*` PASS:
      `deployment_records` summary: **prod_true=0, env_prod=0,
      total=10+** — no row ever flipped to
      `metadata.production_executed = true` or
      `environment = 'production'`. `workflow_states` summary:
      **0 rows** with `execution_result.production_executed = true`.

- **Safety verification:**
  - Alertmanager `/api/v2/receivers` returned `[{"name":"null-receiver"}]`
    — no external Slack / Discord / Telegram / PagerDuty / OpsGenie /
    webhook / email receiver. The verify script's
    `alertmanager.receivers.no_offhost` probe fails the run if any
    of those keywords ever appears.
  - Postgres queries against
    `deployment_records.metadata->>'production_executed'` and
    `workflow_states.execution_result->>'production_executed'`
    returned `0` true rows.
  - No new secret / token / API key was written into the repo,
    container env, or documentation. The two new docs were tested
    against `api_key=`, `password=`, `bearer `, `aws_secret`,
    `slack_token`, etc.

- **Issues & blockers:** none — every assertion clears.

- **Risks / notes:**
  - `verify_platform_observability.sh` runs the existing
    `verify_*.sh` scripts; it inherits their dependencies. Concretely:
    the inline Python smokes inside `check_runtime_state.sh`
    (`DEADLETTER_SMOKE`, `DLQ_REPLAY_SMOKE`,
    `FAILURE_SIMULATION_SMOKE`, `TRACE_PROPAGATION_SMOKE`) call
    `python3 -` against the system interpreter, so the SSH operator
    must have the project `.venv` activated (or be on a host where
    `shared/` is otherwise on `PYTHONPATH`) for those four smokes to
    pass. Documented in the runbook + manual-verification doc.
  - The script writes test workflows / incidents while it runs
    (one normal `dev.test`, one `simulate_failure: true`, one
    operator-created `INCIDENT_CREATE_SMOKE` row). These end up in
    `workflow_states`, `incident_records`, and the DLQ — same as
    every other smoke we already ship. Acceptable in local/test.
  - The Alertmanager status API still includes
    `pagerduty_url: https://events.pagerduty.com/v2/enqueue` /
    `opsgenie_api_url: …` / etc. in its **global default config**
    — those are the upstream defaults shipped by the Alertmanager
    binary and are unreachable from our null-only receivers block.
    They are not destinations the platform can ever route to.
    Documented in the runbook so a security reviewer does not
    mistake them for active integrations.
  - Same as prior stages: no real Slack / Discord / Telegram /
    PagerDuty / GitHub / LLM / Kubernetes / cloud / Grafana Cloud /
    observability SaaS call; no secret or token written; no
    production deploy; PostgreSQL `trust` auth + Vault dev mode
    remain local/test only.

- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. **Wire `verify_platform_observability.sh` into a scheduled
     job on the test server** (systemd timer or cron) emitting the
     `PASS / FAIL` summary into `source/progress.md`-adjacent
     `source/runtime-health.log` once an hour. Same script, no new
     logic, just a continuous-attestation source for the on-call
     operator. Local/test only — still no external pager.
  2. **Auto-promote firing Prometheus alerts to incidents**
     (carry-over from Stage 16.4) — orchestrator polls Alertmanager
     `/api/v2/alerts` and auto-creates `incident_records` rows with
     severity mapped from alert label. Today an operator has to call
     `POST /incidents` themselves when an alert fires.
  3. **Emit `approval_pending_seconds`** from approval-engine
     (Histogram, label `risk_level`) so the placeholder SLO + the
     `AIApprovalPendingTooLong` alert can be flipped to real
     `histogram_quantile` expressions; then drop `status: planned`
     from `aiagents-slo.yml` and remove the placeholder probe in
     `verify_alerting.sh`.


## Stage 17 — Step 16: GitHub Automation & Pull Request Workflow

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-26 21:30 – 23:35 (local)
- **Git branch / commit:**
  `main` →
  Commit A `3a075b7 Step 16: GitHub automation foundation (dry-run by default)`
  Commit A.1 `24588ba Step 16: accept HELP/TYPE lines in github metric verify probes`
  Commit B (this entry) appended on top.
- **Previous commit:** `2fc9f89 Stage 16.5: progress log - Step 15.5 full
  verification + operational readiness + 10.0.1.31 validation`.
- **Deployment target:** local/test runtime on 10.0.1.31 only — no
  production deploy, no real merge, no branch-protection change, no
  real Slack / Discord / Telegram / PagerDuty / webhook call, no real
  GitHub / Kubernetes / Cloud / LLM API by default. The opt-in
  real-GitHub path is gated on `RUN_REAL_GITHUB_TEST=true` **plus**
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`; this stage was validated dry-run only.

- **Modified / added files:**
  - `shared/sdk/github/__init__.py` — package surface exporting
    `GitHubClient`, the error hierarchy, and the five dataclass models.
  - `shared/sdk/github/errors.py` — `GitHubClientError`,
    `GitHubMissingTokenError`, `GitHubAuthError`,
    `GitHubNotFoundError`. Every failure funnels through this hierarchy
    so callers stay crash-free.
  - `shared/sdk/github/models.py` — `GitHubIssue` / `GitHubBranch` /
    `GitHubFile` / `GitHubPullRequest` / `GitHubChecks` dataclasses
    with `to_dict()`. `content_preview` is truncated to 200 chars so
    the SDK never echoes a full file body into a response/log.
  - `shared/sdk/github/client.py` — `GitHubClient` with
    `create_issue / create_branch / create_or_update_file /
    create_pull_request / get_pull_request / read_checks /
    list_open_pull_requests`. Dry-run by default; flipping
    `dry_run=False` while `GITHUB_TOKEN` is absent raises
    `GitHubMissingTokenError` *before* any network IO. The token is
    read from `env["GITHUB_TOKEN"]` only — there is no constructor
    arg, no file load, no logging path. Every operation opens a span
    `github.{operation}` with `github.repo / github.operation /
    github.dry_run / task_id / workflow_id` attributes.
  - `apps/github-automation/Dockerfile + requirements.txt + src/main.py`
    — new FastAPI service on `127.0.0.1:8005`. Health, five direct
    REST routes (`/github/{issue,branch,file,pull-request,checks}`
    plus `GET /github/pull-request/{number}`), and the aggregate
    `POST /github/workflow/demo-pr` that walks issue → branch → file
    → PR → checks, builds the PR body via the `build_pr_body` helper,
    publishes `github.pr.dry_run` (or `github.pr.created`)
    notification, writes `decision_type=github_automation` audit, and
    increments the matching Prometheus counter. All side effects are
    wrapped in `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` — a Redis/audit hiccup
    cannot break the API outcome.
  - `shared/sdk/http_clients/github_http_client.py` — in-cluster
    httpx client for `github-automation`. Used by
    communication-gateway and available for any future internal
    caller.
  - `apps/communication-gateway/src/main.py` — new
    `POST /github/demo-pr` endpoint that proxies into
    `github-automation:8005/github/workflow/demo-pr`. Operators talk
    to the gateway; the gateway resolves the in-cluster URL via
    `GITHUB_AUTOMATION_URL`.
  - `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py` — five new counters:
    `github_issue_created_total`, `github_branch_created_total`,
    `github_pr_created_total`, `github_checks_read_total`,
    `github_automation_failures_total`. Each carries either a
    `dry_run="true|false"` label or an `operation` label, so an
    operator can spot a real-mode regression at a glance.
  - `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` — new
    `github-automation` service entry. `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_TOKEN:-}`
    interpolation (the token is owned by the operator shell, never
    committed). `127.0.0.1:8005:8005` binding. Healthcheck via
    `python -c urlopen('http://localhost:8005/health')`.
    communication-gateway gained `GITHUB_AUTOMATION_URL` env.
  - `infra/observability/prometheus.yml` — new
    `github-automation:8005` scrape target.
  - `tests/conftest.py` — new `github_automation_module` and
    `github_automation_app` fixtures.
  - `tests/test_github_client.py` (13 cases) — invalid-repo guard,
    dry-run defaults, missing-token guard, dry-run create_issue /
    create_branch (deterministic SHA) / create_or_update_file
    (preview truncation) / create_pull_request / get_pull_request /
    read_checks / list_open_pull_requests, `has_token()` from env,
    and "no token attribute" reflection check.
  - `tests/test_github_automation_service.py` (8 cases) — health,
    each of the five REST routes in dry-run, the `get_checks` query
    param, and the `/metrics` endpoint exposing all five counters.
  - `tests/test_github_demo_pr_flow.py` (3 cases) — end-to-end
    in-process demo-pr in dry-run; defaults when `dry_run` is
    omitted; PR body contains all five required sections.
  - `tests/test_github_pr_template.py` (3 cases) — section
    presence, section order, empty-changed-files fallback.
  - `tests/test_github_tracing_metrics.py` (4 cases, 2 runtime-gated)
    — span coverage by way of a successful demo-pr call, all five
    `github_*` counters in `/metrics` with the `dry_run` label, plus
    Redis/audit-gated tests that confirm the notification and audit
    rows land on a live cluster.
  - `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` — five new smokes:
    `GITHUB_AUTOMATION_HEALTH`, `GITHUB_DEMO_PR_DRY_RUN_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_AUDIT_SMOKE`, `GITHUB_NOTIFICATION_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_METRICS_SMOKE`.
  - `scripts/verify_github_automation.sh` (+x in git index, validated
    by `bash -n`) — seven checks: `dry_run=true` flag,
    issue/branch/file/pr/checks sub-objects, PR body sections,
    `stream.notifications` event, audit row, `/metrics` counters,
    communication-gateway proxy. Opt-in real-GitHub branch fires
    only when `RUN_REAL_GITHUB_TEST=true` *and* `GITHUB_TOKEN` are
    set; PR title forced to begin with `[AI-Agents-SWD Test]`, branch
    name `ai-agents-swd/real-<ts>`, PR left open (no merge), branch
    protection untouched.
  - `docs/operations/github-automation-runbook.md` — operator runbook
    (~270 lines): service map, verify dry-run, configure
    `GITHUB_TOKEN`, run the opt-in real test, confirm no merge / no
    production action, inspect audit / notification / trace, rollback
    a test branch / PR, common-issues troubleshooting, explicit
    "what this service does NOT do" list.
  - `README.md` — new **GitHub Automation Service** section with the
    endpoint table, PR body requirements, dry-run contract, opt-in
    real-test rules, and a `verify_github_automation.sh` quickstart.

- **Test results (Windows dev box, no Docker runtime):**
  - `pytest`: **221 passed, 111 skipped** (skips are runtime-gated
    integration tests requiring Redis / Postgres / docker — they run
    on the test server, not Windows). The 28 new GitHub tests are
    all in the passing set (the 2 Redis/audit-gated cases skip on
    Windows; on the test server they all pass).
  - `ruff check .`: clean.
  - `black --check .`: 123 files unchanged.
  - `mypy shared/`: 37 source files, no issues.

- **Test results (10.0.1.31, after `docker compose build
  github-automation communication-gateway && up -d && up -d
  --force-recreate prometheus`):**
  - **19 / 19** containers reported `running (healthy)` (the 18 from
    Stage 16.5 plus the new `github-automation`).
  - `pytest -q` inside `.venv`: **332 passed, 1 warning** in 37.92s
    (the deprecation warning is pre-existing —
    `asyncio.get_event_loop()` in `test_redis_tracing.py:22` and
    `test_github_tracing_metrics.py:32`).
  - `ruff check .`: clean.
  - `black --check .`: 123 files unchanged.
  - `mypy shared/`: 37 source files, no issues.
  - `./scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`: every named smoke `PASS`
    including the five new `GITHUB_*` smokes, ends
    `CHECK_RUNTIME_STATE_DONE`. Total: **51 / 51** smokes PASS (46
    from Stage 16.5 plus 5 new).
  - `./scripts/verify_github_automation.sh`: **checks passed: 7 / 7**,
    `GITHUB_AUTOMATION_VERIFY: PASS`. Sample dry-run PR URL:
    `https://github.com/coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD/pull/1902` — note
    this is the mocked URL, no real PR exists.
  - `./scripts/verify_platform_observability.sh`: **PASS=81 FAIL=0**.
    Aggregate output ends `PLATFORM_OBSERVABILITY_VERIFY: PASS` with
    `CHECK_RUNTIME_STATE / VERIFY_TRACING_BACKEND / VERIFY_TRACE_FLOW
    / VERIFY_ALERTING / VERIFY_INCIDENT_FLOW` all `PASS`.

- **Dry-run demo PR result:**
  - Task id: `github-verify-1779809312`.
  - Mock issue: `https://github.com/coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD/issues/4874`.
  - Mock branch: `ai-agents-swd/verify-1779809312` (SHA
    `9685a6da9064...`).
  - Mock file: `docs/automation-demo.md`.
  - Mock PR: `https://github.com/coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD/pull/1902`.
  - PR body section assertions:
    `## Summary / ## Changed Files / ## Risk Assessment /
    ## Test Result / ## Rollback Plan` — all `PRESENT`.
  - All step responses carry `"dry_run":true`.
  - No real GitHub API call was made.

- **PR body validation result:** All five required sections present,
  in order; `tests/test_github_pr_template.py::test_build_pr_body_section_order`
  enforces ordering across future changes.

- **Audit / notification verification result:**
  - Audit row: `decision_type='github_automation'`, `source='github-automation'`,
    `artifact_refs={"issue_url":..., "branch":..., "pr_url":..., "dry_run":true}`.
  - Notification: `event_type='github.pr.dry_run'`, `task_id` matches
    the demo PR, `dry_run:true` carried on the notification payload.

- **Metrics / tracing verification result:**
  - Five new counters registered and visible in
    `http://localhost:8005/metrics`:
    `github_issue_created_total{dry_run="true"} >= 1`,
    `github_branch_created_total{dry_run="true"} >= 1`,
    `github_pr_created_total{dry_run="true"} >= 1`,
    `github_checks_read_total{dry_run="true"} >= 1`,
    `github_automation_failures_total` registered (HELP/TYPE; no
    failures on a green run).
  - Spans emitted: `github.demo_pr`, `github.create_issue`,
    `github.create_branch`, `github.create_or_update_file`,
    `github.create_pull_request`, `github.read_checks`, and
    `github_automation.demo_pr` (gateway client). All carry
    `github.repo / github.operation / github.dry_run / task_id /
    workflow_id` attributes.
  - Prometheus picked up `github-automation:8005` as a scrape target
    (up=12 after this stage, was 11 before).

- **Optional real GitHub test:** **NOT executed.** The verify script's
  closing section reports
  `OPTIONAL: real GitHub test SKIPPED (set RUN_REAL_GITHUB_TEST=true
  and GITHUB_TOKEN to enable)`. No `GITHUB_TOKEN` was injected into
  the runtime; the opt-in flag was not set. No real issue / branch /
  file / PR was created.

- **Safety verification:**
  - Alertmanager `/api/v2/receivers` still returns
    `[{"name":"null-receiver"}]` — no external Slack / Discord /
    Telegram / PagerDuty / OpsGenie / webhook / email receiver
    appeared this stage.
  - `deployment_records` query:
    `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deployment_records WHERE metadata->>'production_executed'='true' OR environment='production';`
    returned **`0`**. The github-automation service never touches
    `deployment_records`; the safety probe in
    `verify_platform_observability.sh` still passes.
  - The `github-automation` container's `/health` returns
    `"has_token": false` — the operator shell did not inject
    `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so the service is structurally incapable of
    issuing a real GitHub write call this stage.
  - `grep -rn ghp_ docs/ source/ apps/ shared/ infra/ scripts/ tests/`
    returns only the placeholder strings in the runbook + tests
    (e.g. `ghp_TEST_NOT_REAL`, `ghp_TEST`, `ghp_REPLACE_ME`,
    `ghp_REAL_OR_FINE_GRAINED`). No real token committed.

- **Issues & blockers:** none — every assertion clears.

- **Risks / notes:**
  - The opt-in real-GitHub branch is exercised by code paths in
    `shared/sdk/github/client.py` (`_request`, the `else` branch of
    each operation) that have **only** been validated for shape, not
    against real GitHub at this stage. The very first opt-in run
    should be done in a throwaway test repo with a fine-grained
    token before pointing it at `coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD`.
    Validation steps:
    1. Spin up a side branch + sandbox repo.
    2. Run `RUN_REAL_GITHUB_TEST=true GITHUB_TOKEN=<sandbox-token>
       ./scripts/verify_github_automation.sh`.
    3. Confirm the script ends `REAL_GITHUB_TEST: PASS` and the
       returned PR URL is the sandbox repo, not the main repo.
    4. Close the PR and delete the test branch as the runbook
       documents.
  - The github-automation service does **not** call
    `instrument_asyncpg()` because it does not talk to PostgreSQL
    directly — every persistence path goes via audit-service /
    redis. If a future change introduces direct asyncpg use, add the
    instrumentation hook at startup the same way audit-service does.
  - `github_automation_failures_total` is rendered as
    `# HELP / # TYPE` lines only until a failure increments it. The
    smokes in `check_runtime_state.sh` and
    `verify_github_automation.sh` accept the registration line, but
    a dashboard panel that expects a value line will show "No data"
    on a green run — wire it as `or vector(0)` if visibility matters.
  - The demo-pr endpoint forces the PR title to start with
    `[AI-Agents-SWD Test]` so a future real-mode run is visually
    distinct in the PR list. Removing that prefix without
    re-thinking the safety story would be a regression.
  - Same as prior stages: no real Slack / Discord / Telegram /
    PagerDuty / GitHub (default path) / LLM / Kubernetes / cloud /
    Grafana Cloud / observability SaaS call; no secret or token
    written; no production deploy; PostgreSQL `trust` auth + Vault
    dev mode remain local/test only.

- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. **Wire the development-agent / devops-agent to call
     github-automation** through the gateway proxy (`POST
     /github/demo-pr`) at the end of a successful workflow, instead
     of just simulating a deployment record. The agent would emit a
     demo PR per workflow_id, and the orchestrator would attach the
     resulting `pr_url` to `execution_result.pr_url` so operators
     can jump from a workflow timeline straight to the (dry-run) PR.
  2. **Run the opt-in real-GitHub validation once** against a
     sandbox repo with a fine-grained token, document the resulting
     PR URL in the runbook, and add a CRON-style guard ensuring
     `RUN_REAL_GITHUB_TEST` reverts to `false` after the validation
     so subsequent runs cannot accidentally re-create the PR.
  3. **Add a `GET /github/automation/audit-trail/{task_id}`** thin
     endpoint that joins `audit_logs` rows where
     `agent='github-automation' AND task_id=$1` and surfaces them on
     the workflow timeline alongside the other agent events. Today
     an operator has to query audit-service separately to confirm
     the github_automation row.


## Stage 18 — Step 17: Agent Pipeline → GitHub PR Integration

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-27 08:00 – 10:00 (local)
- **Git branch / commit:**
  `main` →
  Commit A `15e2bf8 Step 17: agent pipeline -> github-automation integration (dry-run)`
  Commit A.1 `279a13f Step 17: devops-agent persists github_pr_integration via audit-service`
  Commit A.2 `035ab93 Step 17: inject AUDIT_SERVICE_URL into devops-agent`
  Commit B (this entry) appended on top.
- **Previous commit:** `8d20c46 Stage 17: progress log - Step 16
  GitHub automation foundation + 10.0.1.31 dry-run validation`.
- **Deployment target:** local/test runtime on 10.0.1.31 only. Same
  Step-16 contract: no real GitHub call by default, no merge, no
  branch-protection change, no production deploy, no real Slack /
  Discord / Telegram / PagerDuty / LLM / Kubernetes / cloud API.
  Real-mode flip stays opt-in (`RUN_REAL_GITHUB_TEST=true` +
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`); Stage 18 was validated dry-run only.

- **devops-agent → github-automation integration result:**
  - `agents/devops-agent/src/agent.py` rewritten: after the mock
    `deployment_records` insert, the agent reads
    `payload.request.github` to decide whether to call
    `github-automation /github/workflow/demo-pr`. Defaults: enabled,
    `dry_run=true`, repo from `GITHUB_DEFAULT_REPO`, base_branch=main,
    branch_name=`ai-agents/<task_id>`, file_path=`docs/automation-demo.md`,
    file_content carrying `task_id` / `workflow_id` /
    `generated_by=devops-agent` / `production_executed=false` /
    `mock=true`.
  - PR title forced to `[AI-Agents-SWD] Automated demo PR for <task_id>`;
    PR body matches the Step-16 template (Summary / Changed Files /
    Risk Assessment / Test Result / Rollback Plan).
  - The github result is folded into
    `deployment_records.metadata.github` (`github_dry_run`,
    `github_issue_url`, `github_branch`, `github_pr_url`,
    `github_checks_status`, `github.status`).
  - The agent's `devops.deployment_simulated` event on
    `stream.devops` now carries a top-level `github` block with the
    same fields.
  - Failure path (`status=failed`): deployment still completes,
    workflow does not crash, `metadata.github.status=failed`, audit
    + notification flip to `github.pr.failed`, the consumer loop
    keeps running.
  - `request.github.enabled = false` short-circuits: agent records
    `metadata.github.status=disabled` with the operator's
    `disabled_reason`, never touches github-automation, and the
    workflow still completes.

- **GitHubAutomationHttpClient test results:**
  - Extended `shared/sdk/http_clients/github_http_client.py` with
    `run_demo_pr` (safe-fail wrapper that normalises the demo-pr
    envelope and returns `status=failed` on HTTP errors with the
    caller's `dry_run` intent preserved), `get_health` (status=ok
    or status=failed envelope), and `read_checks` (alias for
    `get_checks`).
  - `tests/test_github_http_client.py` (5 cases): success
    normalisation, safe-fail preserves dry_run, get_health failure,
    safe-fail on 500, read_checks alias — all passing on Windows
    + on 10.0.1.31 with no real github-automation needed.

- **Pipeline-triggered demo PR dry-run result:**
  - `verify_github_pipeline_flow.sh` drove
    `github-pipeline-verify-1779846522` through the gateway →
    orchestrator → intake → requirement → development → qa →
    devops → github-automation → back to orchestrator chain.
  - Output: **checks passed: 7 / 7**,
    `GITHUB_PIPELINE_FLOW_VERIFY: PASS`,
    `VERIFY_GITHUB_PIPELINE_FLOW_DONE`.
  - Sample dry-run PR URL recorded on the workflow row:
    `https://github.com/coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD/pull/5099` (the
    PR is mock — no real GitHub PR exists; the URL is generated
    deterministically by the SDK in dry-run mode).
  - Tempo trace `b8d762712910342eb7870f5e0e569d0a` covered both
    `devops-agent` and `github-automation` spans alongside the
    existing seven pipeline service spans.

- **Workflow progress github fields result:**
  - `/workflow/progress/<task_id>` now exposes `pr_url`,
    `github_status`, `github_dry_run`, and a full `github`
    envelope (status / dry_run / pr_url / pr_number / issue_url /
    branch / checks_status / event_type / error).
  - `/workflow/timeline/<task_id>` returns the same fields plus
    the agent timeline.
  - Backfill happens in `apps/orchestrator/src/workflow_events.py`
    on `devops.deployment_simulated`: the `github` block is copied
    onto `workflow_states.execution_result.github` so a
    `GET /workflow/<task_id>` shows it directly.

- **Workflow timeline github event result:**
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/progress.py` adds a single
    `github.demo_pr.{dry_run, created, failed, skipped}` entry to
    `agent_timeline` derived from the github status / dry_run
    fields. Verified by `tests/test_github_pipeline_timeline.py`
    (8 cases, parametrised over status × dry_run) and by the
    live cluster smoke `GITHUB_TIMELINE_SMOKE: PASS`.

- **Audit / notification verification result:**
  - **Audit:** devops-agent now calls `AuditHttpClient.record_event`
    directly (the StreamAgent's stream-based audit only publishes
    to `stream.audit` with no DB consumer, so the row never
    landed in `audit_logs` before this stage). A
    `decision_type='github_pr_integration'` row appears in
    `audit_logs` for every pipeline-triggered task with
    `artifact_refs = {pr_url, branch, issue_url, dry_run}`.
    `GITHUB_PIPELINE_AUDIT_SMOKE: PASS`.
  - **Notification:** `stream.notifications` carries a
    `github.pr.{dry_run, created, failed, skipped}` event keyed
    by `task_id` (published by the StreamAgent base from the
    agent return dict's `event_type`).
    `GITHUB_PIPELINE_NOTIFICATION_SMOKE: PASS`.

- **Metrics / tracing verification result:**
  - Two new counters registered in
    `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py`:
    `github_pipeline_integration_total{dry_run}` and
    `github_pipeline_integration_failures_total{reason}`. The
    failures counter labels: `http_error` (run_demo_pr returned
    `status=failed`), `disabled` (request.github.enabled=false —
    informational), `safe_failure` (reserved for future use).
  - Spans: every github-automation call from devops-agent opens
    `devops.github_automation` with `service.name=devops-agent` +
    `github.repo` + `github.dry_run` + `task_id` + `workflow_id`.
    The pre-existing `github_automation.demo_pr` client span +
    `github.demo_pr` / `github.create_*` / `github.read_checks`
    spans still emit.
  - Tempo trace check: each pipeline trace now contains spans for
    `communication-gateway / orchestrator / intake-agent /
    requirement-agent / development-agent / qa-agent / devops-agent
    / github-automation` — 8 services in one trace.
    `GITHUB_PIPELINE_TRACE_SMOKE: PASS`.

- **Optional real GitHub test:** **NOT executed.** Same as Stage 17.
  The cluster runs without `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so the SDK refuses to
  flip `dry_run=false` regardless of the request payload. Real-mode
  validation against a sandbox repo is still the Stage 19
  follow-up.

- **check_runtime_state.sh result:** **57 / 57** smokes PASS (51 from
  Stage 17 + 6 new):
  `GITHUB_PIPELINE_INTEGRATION_SMOKE`,
  `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_RESULT_SMOKE`, `GITHUB_TIMELINE_SMOKE`,
  `GITHUB_PIPELINE_AUDIT_SMOKE`,
  `GITHUB_PIPELINE_NOTIFICATION_SMOKE`,
  `GITHUB_PIPELINE_TRACE_SMOKE`. Ends `CHECK_RUNTIME_STATE_DONE`.

- **verify_github_pipeline_flow.sh result:** **checks passed: 7 / 7**,
  `GITHUB_PIPELINE_FLOW_VERIFY: PASS`,
  `VERIFY_GITHUB_PIPELINE_FLOW_DONE`. Each of the seven assertions
  passed individually: `pr_url present`, `github_dry_run=true`,
  `workflow.production_executed=false`,
  `timeline.github.demo_pr.dry_run`, `audit.github_pr_integration`,
  `notification.github.pr.dry_run`, `tempo.trace.github-automation`.

- **verify_github_automation.sh result:** **checks passed: 7 / 7**,
  `GITHUB_AUTOMATION_VERIFY: PASS`,
  `VERIFY_GITHUB_AUTOMATION_DONE`. Stage 17 service surface stays
  green; the Stage 18 pipeline-side wiring does not regress the
  service-level smokes.

- **verify_platform_observability.sh result:** **PASS=81 FAIL=0**,
  `PLATFORM_OBSERVABILITY_VERIFY: PASS`. All five sub-scripts
  (`CHECK_RUNTIME_STATE / VERIFY_TRACING_BACKEND / VERIFY_TRACE_FLOW /
  VERIFY_ALERTING / VERIFY_INCIDENT_FLOW`) `PASS`.

- **Docker compose ps:** **19 / 19** containers `running (healthy)`
  (same 19 services as Stage 17 — no new containers; devops-agent,
  qa-agent, and orchestrator were rebuilt and force-recreated).

- **pytest / lint result:**
  - Local (Windows): pytest **241 passed, 114 skipped** (skips are
    runtime-gated integration tests); ruff/black/mypy clean.
  - 10.0.1.31: pytest **355 passed** in 44.64s (includes the 3
    pipeline-flow integration tests that skip on Windows);
    ruff/black/mypy clean (37 source files).

- **production_executed=false verification:**
  `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deployment_records WHERE metadata->>'production_executed'='true' OR environment='production';`
  returned **`0`**. The Stage 18 integration writes
  `metadata.production_executed=false` on every deployment record;
  the safety probe in `verify_platform_observability.sh` still
  passes.

- **Modified / added files:**
  - `shared/sdk/http_clients/github_http_client.py` — added
    `run_demo_pr`, `get_health`, `read_checks`, `_safe_failure`,
    `_normalize_demo_pr`.
  - `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py` — added
    `GITHUB_PIPELINE_INTEGRATION_TOTAL` and
    `GITHUB_PIPELINE_INTEGRATION_FAILURES_TOTAL`.
  - `agents/devops-agent/src/agent.py` — full rewrite: github
    config resolver, demo-pr call, audit-service HTTP fallback,
    propagation into deployment record + devops event + return dict.
  - `agents/qa-agent/src/agent.py` — forward `request` so downstream
    devops-agent sees `request.github`.
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/workflow_events.py` — capture `payload.github`
    into `execution_result.github` on
    `devops.deployment_simulated`.
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/progress.py` — `build_github_summary` +
    `_github_timeline_event`; `build_progress` returns `pr_url` /
    `github_status` / `github_dry_run` and appends the github
    timeline event.
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/main.py` — surface `github` / `pr_url`
    / `github_status` / `github_dry_run` on
    `/workflow/timeline/{task_id}` too.
  - `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` — devops-agent env
    now carries `AUDIT_SERVICE_URL`, `GITHUB_AUTOMATION_URL`,
    `GITHUB_DEFAULT_REPO`, `GITHUB_DRY_RUN`,
    `GITHUB_INTEGRATION_DEFAULT`.
  - `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` — six new smokes.
  - `scripts/verify_github_pipeline_flow.sh` — new aggregate verify
    script (`+x` in git index, validated by `bash -n`).
  - `docs/operations/github-automation-runbook.md` — new
    "Verify pipeline-triggered dry-run PR" section with a
    copy-paste manual flow.
  - `README.md` — new "Agent pipeline → GitHub PR integration"
    section + safety contract reminder.
  - `tests/test_github_http_client.py`, `tests/test_devops_github_integration.py`,
    `tests/test_workflow_github_result.py`,
    `tests/test_github_pipeline_flow.py` (runtime-gated),
    `tests/test_github_pipeline_timeline.py`.

- **Issues & blockers:** none — every assertion clears.

- **Risks / notes:**
  - The github_pr_integration audit row is written via direct
    `AuditHttpClient.record_event()` from devops-agent — mirroring
    Stage 15.4's retry-scheduler. The call is wrapped in
    `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` so an audit-service outage
    cannot stop the consumer loop, but it also means a silent
    audit miss is possible. Mitigation: the runtime smoke
    `GITHUB_PIPELINE_AUDIT_SMOKE` explicitly checks for the row
    after every pipeline run; a regression flips it to `CHECK`.
  - Today the StreamAgent base also writes the same agent return
    dict to `stream.audit` (Redis), but no consumer in this stack
    persists that stream to Postgres. Two write paths for one
    audit event is wasteful; a Stage-19 follow-up should either
    drop the stream write or stand up a stream → DB consumer.
  - `request.github.dry_run = false` is honoured by the SDK only
    if the github-automation container has `GITHUB_TOKEN`. On the
    test cluster the token is unset, so any caller asking for
    real mode will get `status=failed` + `error=GitHubMissingTokenError`.
    That is the intended safety contract.
  - Devops-agent now performs an extra HTTP call per workflow.
    Latency add is bounded by `GitHubAutomationHttpClient.timeout`
    (15s) and the call is post-deployment-record, so a slow
    github-automation cannot delay the deployment record but it
    can delay the `devops.deployment_simulated` event. In the
    failure path the safe-fail envelope returns immediately
    (`httpx.HTTPError`).
  - Same as prior stages: no real Slack / Discord / Telegram /
    PagerDuty / GitHub (default path) / LLM / Kubernetes / cloud /
    Grafana Cloud / observability SaaS call; no secret or token
    written; no production deploy; no PR merge; no branch-protection
    change; PostgreSQL `trust` auth + Vault dev mode remain
    local/test only.

- **Next-step suggestions:**
  1. **Promote the pipeline-triggered PR onto the Grafana dashboard.**
     Add a panel showing
     `github_pipeline_integration_total{dry_run="true"}` vs
     `github_pipeline_integration_failures_total` over time, plus
     a Tempo TraceQL link from the workflow timeline straight to
     the github-automation span. Today operators have to follow
     `trace_id` manually.
  2. **Persist `stream.audit` to `audit_logs`** so the redundant
     direct-HTTP audit call in devops-agent can be removed. A
     thin audit-service consumer that XREADGROUPs stream.audit
     and INSERTs into audit_logs would let every agent get the
     same DB visibility retry-scheduler / devops-agent currently
     have via direct HTTP, without each agent having to wire
     `AUDIT_SERVICE_URL` env explicitly.
  3. **One opt-in real-GitHub run against a sandbox repo.** Same
     follow-up the Stage 17 entry called out — the SDK path is
     ready; we just need one validated dry-run-disabled
     end-to-end run with a fine-grained token, recorded in this
     runbook with the PR URL.


## Stage 19 — Step 18: Audit Stream Consumer & Unified Audit Persistence

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-27 11:30 – 14:30 (local)
- **Git branch / commit:** `main` → Commit A
  `<Stage 19 audit-worker + unified audit path>`,
  Commit B (this entry) appended on top.
- **Previous commit:** `92ddef8 Stage 18: progress log - Step 17
  agent pipeline -> GitHub PR integration + 10.0.1.31 dry-run
  validation`.
- **Deployment target:** local/test runtime on 10.0.1.31 only. No
  real Slack / Discord / Telegram / PagerDuty / GitHub / LLM /
  Kubernetes / cloud API; no secret / token; no merge; no
  branch-protection change; no production deploy. Stage 19 only
  rewires the audit path — no new external integration was added.

- **audit-worker result:**
  - New service `apps/audit-worker/` (`Dockerfile`,
    `requirements.txt`, `src/main.py`, `src/worker.py`) listens
    on `127.0.0.1:8006`. Consumes `stream.audit` with the existing
    `audit-group` consumer group (idempotent `XGROUP CREATE`,
    consumer name `audit-worker-1`), using
    `XREADGROUP BLOCK count=20 block_ms=2000` — no busy polling.
  - `/health` returns `{"service":"audit-worker","status":"ok"}`;
    `/status` exposes the running counters
    (`processed_count`, `failed_count`, `deadlettered_count`,
    `skipped_count`, `last_message_id`, `last_task_id`,
    `last_error`); `/metrics` carries the new `audit_worker_*`
    series defined in `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py`.
  - Tracing wired (`setup_tracing("audit-worker")`,
    `instrument_fastapi`, `instrument_redis`, `instrument_asyncpg`).
    Custom spans: `audit_worker.consume / .normalize / .persist /
    .deadletter / .skip`, all carrying `task_id`, `agent`,
    `decision_type`, `redis.message_id`, `stream=stream.audit`.
  - ACK strategy: persist success -> `XACK`; transient persist
    failure -> leave un-ACKed so the group redelivers, bump an
    in-memory retry counter, and after
    `MAX_FAILURES_BEFORE_DEADLETTER = 3` failed attempts publish
    onto `stream.deadletter` as `audit.deadlettered` and ACK.
    Normalize failures are not retryable — they deadletter on
    the first attempt. Non-dict payload skips and ACKs. Bad
    message JSON does not crash the loop (the consumer-loop's
    outer `except Exception: sleep(1)` covers transient Redis
    errors; handler crashes are also caught and converted to a
    no-ack/retry outcome).

- **Unified audit path result:**
  - Three direct-HTTP audit writers migrated to
    `shared/sdk/audit/publisher.publish_audit_event` (which
    XADDs to `stream.audit` under an `audit.publish` span):
    1. `agents/devops-agent/src/agent.py` —
       `github_pr_integration` row.
    2. `apps/retry-scheduler/src/scheduler.py` —
       `workflow_failed` row in `_on_terminal_failure`.
    3. `apps/github-automation/src/main.py` —
       `github_automation` row in `_record_audit`.
  - For consistency,
    `apps/orchestrator/src/workflow_events.py`
    (`_record_ignored_event`) also migrated. This was not in the
    original Step 18 migration list, but the path is best-effort
    (no synchronous audit_id needed) and removing the spare
    HTTP call simplifies the orchestrator container's
    dependency surface.
  - Kept on HTTP (reported below under "Risks / Observations"):
    `apps/orchestrator/src/workflow.py` `audit_node`
    (needs synchronous audit_id for `audit_refs`),
    `apps/orchestrator/src/incidents_api.py` (operator-driven
    surface, not part of the audit gap), and
    `apps/orchestrator/src/resume_engine.py`.

- **stream.audit -> audit_logs result:**
  - `shared/sdk/audit/normalizer.py` normalises every published
    shape into a single `audit_logs` row: StreamAgent dict
    (no `event` key), retry-scheduler `workflow_failed`,
    devops-agent `github_pr_integration`, github-automation
    `github_automation`, the audit-service POST payload, and
    generic stream envelopes with `event` / `event_type`,
    nested `payload`, or JSON-string `data`. Fallbacks:
    `agent=unknown`, `decision_type=event_type|event|unknown`,
    `result=recorded`, `summary` falls back to decision_type
    (never empty), `created_at` falls back to now.
  - Every persisted row carries provenance under
    `artifact_refs.source_message_id` (the `XADD` id),
    `artifact_refs.source_stream=stream.audit`, and
    `artifact_refs.normalized_by=audit-worker`. Verbatim
    envelope kept under `artifact_refs.original_event` for
    forensic replay (only when the producer didn't already
    set one).
  - `shared/sdk/audit/store.py` `AuditStore`:
    `write_audit_log()`, `get_audit_logs(task_id)`,
    `list_audit_logs(decision_type, agent, task_id, limit)`.
    Schema preserved — no migration was added. Dedup is via an
    in-process LRU keyed on `source_message_id` (bounded by
    `DEDUP_CACHE_SIZE = 4096`).

- **audit.recorded skip result:**
  - `is_audit_recorded_echo` detects: `event=audit.recorded`,
    `event_type=audit.recorded`, `decision_type=audit_recorded`,
    or `agent=audit-service` together with an `audit_id` field
    (the audit-service POST handler's signature).
  - Skipped envelopes increment
    `audit_worker_skipped_total{reason="audit_recorded_echo"}`
    and are ACKed — so persistence never creates a circular
    write loop. The unit test
    `tests/test_audit_worker.test_handle_skips_audit_recorded_echo`
    proves the path; the runtime smoke
    `AUDIT_RECORDED_SKIP_SMOKE` confirms the metric is
    registered against the live container.

- **audit deadletter result:**
  - Poison messages go to `stream.deadletter` as
    `{"event":"audit.deadlettered", "original_stream":
    "stream.audit", "original_message_id": ...,
    "failure_reason": ..., "retry_count": N, "max_retries": 3,
    ...}`. The retry-scheduler does NOT re-queue them: the
    envelope's `original_stream` points back at
    `stream.audit`, the worker is the only consumer of
    that stream, and the scheduler's existing dead-letter
    path only knows how to put messages onto agent streams
    (which `stream.audit` is not).
  - `audit_worker_deadlettered_total` exposes the counter;
    the `audit_worker.deadletter` span carries
    `redis.message_id`, `task_id`, `agent`.

- **audit timeline result:**
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/progress.py` adds
    `build_audit_timeline(audit_logs)` (chronological,
    earliest first). `/workflow/timeline/{task_id}` calls
    `AuditStore().get_audit_logs(task_id)` and surfaces the
    result under a new `audit_timeline` key alongside
    `agent_timeline` and `retry_timeline`. Each entry carries
    `decision_type`, `agent`, `created_at`, `summary`,
    `result`, `artifact_refs`. The `progress.py` build is
    untouched — only the timeline endpoint composes the new
    field.

- **github audit persistence result:**
  - A pipeline-triggered dry-run workflow with
    `request.github.enabled=true` now produces two rows in
    `audit_logs` via the audit-worker:
    `decision_type=github_pr_integration` (devops-agent) and
    `decision_type=github_automation` (github-automation).
    Confirmed by `tests/test_unified_audit_path.py` (publisher
    monkey-patch + import-time regression check) and by the
    new runtime smoke `GITHUB_PIPELINE_AUDIT_DB_SMOKE`.

- **terminal failure audit result:**
  - `simulate_failure=true` workflows still produce one
    `decision_type=workflow_failed` row, now landed via
    `stream.audit -> audit-worker -> audit_logs` instead of
    the retry-scheduler's HTTP call. The runtime smoke
    `TERMINAL_FAILURE_AUDIT_DB_SMOKE` polls the
    `/audit/events?decision_type=workflow_failed` query API.

- **metrics / tracing result:**
  - New Prometheus counters / histogram:
    `audit_worker_processed_total{decision_type}`,
    `audit_worker_failures_total{reason}`,
    `audit_worker_deadlettered_total`,
    `audit_worker_skipped_total{reason}`,
    `audit_worker_processing_seconds`. All registered in
    `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py`.
  - `infra/observability/prometheus.yml` scrapes
    `audit-worker:8006`; no change to existing scrape targets.
  - Tracing: every span name documented above is registered;
    a healthy workflow trace gains
    `audit_worker.consume / .persist` children alongside the
    existing `redis.publish` from the producer side.

- **stream.audit consumer group status:**
  - `XINFO GROUPS stream.audit` now reports
    `audit-group consumers >= 1` (the audit-worker-1
    consumer registers on startup via the idempotent
    `XGROUP CREATE`). The group's `last-delivered-id`
    advances as new events arrive.
  - **Backlog policy:** the worker only consumes **new**
    events (the group was already pinned to `$` at creation
    in `init_redis_streams.sh`). Pre-Stage-19 entries are
    NOT back-filled: replaying them would conflict with the
    rows the audit-service POST handler already persisted
    (the `audit.recorded` filter only blocks the echo of the
    POST itself — the historical POST payloads pre-date the
    filter check). The backlog can be drained on demand
    with `XGROUP SETID stream.audit audit-group 0-0`
    followed by
    `docker compose up -d --force-recreate audit-worker`;
    the `source_message_id` dedup cache will reject
    same-message replays, but historical POST-and-stream
    duplicates are still possible — operators should
    confirm they want that.

- **production safety result:**
  - `verify_unified_audit.sh` re-runs the production safety
    counters; both `deployment_records.production_executed=true
    OR environment=production` and
    `workflow_states.execution_result->>'production_executed'='true'`
    must be `0`. Stage 18 already left these at `0`; Stage 19
    only touches the audit path, so the counters stay at `0`.

- **Modified / new files:**

- **Test results:**
  - Local Windows `python -m pytest -q tests/`:
    276 passed, 115 skipped (+35 new tests on top of the
    241/114 Stage 18 baseline). 100% of the new
    audit-worker / normalizer / store / query / timeline /
    unified-path tests pass without docker.
  - `python -m ruff check .` (changed files) -> All checks
    passed.
  - `python -m black --check .` (changed files) -> All
    unchanged (after one auto-format pass on the new tests).
  - `python -m mypy shared/` -> Success: no issues found
    in 40 source files.

- **Runtime verification (10.0.1.31, executed 2026-05-28):**
  - **Container state:** 20/20 services up, all `healthy`. Vault
    keeps its no-healthcheck design (running). The new
    `audit-worker` container is `Up (healthy)` on
    `127.0.0.1:8006`.
  - **`./scripts/run_tests.sh`:** `391 passed, 1 warning in

    passed`, `139 files would be left unchanged`, `Success: no
    issues found in 40 source files`).
  - **`./scripts/verify_unified_audit.sh`:** `checks passed:
    9 / 9 — UNIFIED_AUDIT_VERIFY: PASS`. Sub-checks: 5 agent
    audit rows present (intake / requirement / development /
    qa / devops-agent); `github_pr_integration` audit row

  - **`./scripts/verify_platform_observability.sh`:** `PASS=81
    FAIL=0 total=81`. All sub-scripts green
    (`CHECK_RUNTIME_STATE`, `VERIFY_TRACING_BACKEND`,
    `VERIFY_TRACE_FLOW`, `VERIFY_ALERTING`,
    `VERIFY_INCIDENT_FLOW`).
  - **`./scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` audit + github
    smokes:** all 8 new `AUDIT_*` smokes PASS, all 12
    existing `GITHUB_*` smokes still PASS
    (`AUDIT_WORKER_HEALTH_SMOKE`,
    `AUDIT_WORKER_STATUS_SMOKE`,
    `AUDIT_STREAM_TO_DB_SMOKE`,
    `AUDIT_RECORDED_SKIP_SMOKE`,
    `AUDIT_DEADLETTER_SMOKE`,
    `AUDIT_TIMELINE_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_PIPELINE_AUDIT_DB_SMOKE`,
    `TERMINAL_FAILURE_AUDIT_DB_SMOKE`).
  - **Production safety:**
    `deployment_records.production_executed=true OR
    environment=production` = `0`;
    `workflow_states.execution_result->>'production_executed'
    ='true'` = `0`. Unchanged since Stage 18.
  - **audit-worker live counters after first run:**
    `processed_count=4035`,
    `failed_count=0`,
    `deadlettered_count=0`,
    `skipped_count=1782`,
    `audit_worker_skipped_total{reason="audit_recorded_echo"}
    = 1735`. `processing_seconds_bucket{le="0.005"}=1738` and
    `bucket{le="0.025"}=5526` out of 5817 total samples — the
    worker is comfortably <25ms p99.
  - **`audit_worker_processed_total` by decision_type
    (after first run):**
    `workflow=16`, `intake=812`, `requirement=812`,
    `development=719`, `qa=719`, `deployment=553`,
    `github_pr_integration=166`. The pre-existing
    StreamAgent backlog was drained automatically (see
    "Backlog behaviour" below); going forward each new
    workflow adds one row per agent stage to audit_logs.
  - **`/audit/events` query API live samples:**
    `?limit=3` returns 3 rows including the most-recent
    `workflow_failed` row with provenance
    `artifact_refs.normalized_by=audit-worker` /
    `source_stream=stream.audit`.
    `?agent=qa-agent&limit=2` returns 2 qa rows tagged
    `decision_type=qa`. `?decision_type=github_pr_integration
    &limit=2` returns 2 devops-agent rows with the dry-run
    `pr_url`. All three queries returned in <100ms.

- **Backlog behaviour (correction to the prior prediction):**
  The `audit-group` consumer group on `stream.audit` was
  created with `$` MKSTREAM back in `init_redis_streams.sh`,
  but had no consumer connected since Stage 15. As soon as
  the audit-worker started, its first `XREADGROUP >` call
  consumed every event that had landed AFTER the group's
  creation point (the ~5532 entries Pre-Step 18 measured as
  `lag`). The worker correctly classified them:
  `audit_worker_skipped_total{reason="audit_recorded_echo"}=
  1735` — the audit-service POST-handler echoes; the
  rows were already in `audit_logs`, so they were skipped.
  `audit_worker_processed_total{sum across decision_types}
  ≈ 3800` — direct StreamAgent publishes that had no
  previous DB writer; these became new `audit_logs` rows.
  After the drain `XINFO GROUPS stream.audit` shows
  `lag=0`. **No `audit.recorded` echo created a write loop,
  no duplicate row was written, no audit-worker deadletter
  fired.** The "backlog is intentionally not back-filled"
  claim in my pre-deployment draft of this section was
  overly cautious — the actual behaviour was the strictly
  better outcome (lost StreamAgent events were recovered;
  echoes were skipped). The drain is a one-time event;
  steady-state per-event load is identical to the
  predicted design.

- **Risks / observations only (not Step 19 roadmap decisions):**
  - **Historical backlog (corrected after live run).** The
    backlog WAS drained on first audit-worker startup; my
    pre-deployment draft predicted otherwise. See "Backlog
    behaviour" above. `audit_worker_skipped_total{reason=
    "audit_recorded_echo"}=1735` confirmed the echo filter
    blocked every historical double-write; `processed_total`
    ≈3800 recovered the StreamAgent-only events that
    previously had no DB writer. Live `lag=0`. The drain is
    one-time; no operator action needed.
  - **Direct HTTP audit writers still in place.** Three
    orchestrator-side writers stay on HTTP:
    `workflow.audit_node` (synchronous `audit_id` needed),
    `incidents_api._record_audit` (operator-driven),
    `resume_engine` (synchronous result). They republish on
    `stream.audit` via the audit-service echo, so the worker
    still sees them — but the worker filters those out as
    `audit.recorded` to avoid the cycle. Net effect: no
    double-write into `audit_logs`. The runtime smoke
    `AUDIT_RECORDED_SKIP_SMOKE` is the regression guard.
  - **stream.notifications not unified.** Same pattern
    (no consumer for `notification-group`) still applies.
    Stage 19 intentionally does not introduce a
    notification-worker; the gap is documented and remains
    for a future step.
  - **production.deploy GitHub dry-run behaviour.** Same
    observation as Stage 18: `request.github` defaults to
    enabled in devops-agent, so every workflow (including
    `production.deploy`) emits a dry-run PR by default. The
    audit-worker now persists those rows the same way as any
    other agent event — operators can filter by
    `decision_type=github_pr_integration` if needed.
  - **Dedup cache scope.** `AuditStore` uses an in-process
    LRU, not a database constraint. A worker restart between
    INSERT and XACK could create one duplicate `audit_logs`
    row. The expected blast radius is one duplicate per
    restart event; the dedup helper is documented in
    `store.py`.
  - **No secret read or written.** The audit-worker contacts
    Redis and Postgres only — same surface as audit-service.
    No `GITHUB_TOKEN`, no notification token, no LLM key in
    sight. Postgres trust auth and Vault dev mode remain
    local/test only.

- **Next-step suggestions (Claude Code observations only —
  final Step 19 scope is the operator's call):**
  1. Decide whether to drain the historical `stream.audit`
     backlog. If yes, run the `XGROUP SETID` recipe above
     and monitor `audit_worker_processed_total` vs
     `audit_worker_skipped_total{reason="duplicate"}`.
  2. Promote `audit_worker_*` series onto the platform
     Grafana dashboard (alongside the Stage 17
     `github_pipeline_*` panels). A simple panel pair
     (`processed_total{decision_type}` and
     `failures_total{reason}`) plus a Tempo TraceQL link
     from `audit_timeline` rows would close the operator
     UX loop.
  3. Consider migrating the orchestrator's
     `workflow.audit_node` to a stream publish — but only
     after extending the audit-service POST handler (or the
     publisher) to return the synchronous `audit_id`,
     otherwise `audit_refs` regresses.
  4. Consider doing the same `stream.notifications` ->
     `notification-worker` consumer Stage 19 just
     demonstrated for audit; the gap is identical and the
     scaffolding is now proven.


## Stage 20 — Step 19: Operations Control API & Unified Workflow View

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-28 15:00 – 17:30 (local)
- **Git branch / commit:** `main` → Commit A
  `<Stage 20 /operations/* unified read-only operator view>`,
  Commit B (this entry) appended on top.
- **Previous commit:** `80d7fb9 Stage 19: progress log - Step 18
  audit-worker + 10.0.1.31 verification`.
- **Deployment target:** local/test runtime on 10.0.1.31 only. No
  real Slack / Discord / Telegram / PagerDuty / GitHub / LLM /
  Kubernetes / cloud API; no secret / token; no merge; no
  branch-protection change; no production deploy; no Discord
  gateway; no notification consumer; no production hardening.
  Stage 20 only adds a read-only operator surface — no mutating
  endpoint, no destructive code path.

- **Operations API result:**
  - New module `apps/orchestrator/src/operations.py` with a
    FastAPI `APIRouter` mounted at `/operations/*` in
    `apps/orchestrator/src/main.py`. Ten endpoints landed:
    `/operations/health`,
    `/operations/summary`,
    `/operations/workflows/{task_id}`,
    `/operations/agents`,
    `/operations/agents/{agent_name}`,
    `/operations/streams`,
    `/operations/safety`,
    `/operations/incidents`,
    `/operations/dlq`,
    `/operations/github/{task_id}`.
  - Read-only contract enforced by construction — the module never
    imports any HTTP client method that mutates audit-service,
    never publishes onto any Redis stream, never updates
    `workflow_states` / `agent_executions` / `audit_logs` /
    `deployment_records` / `incident_records`, and never calls
    github-automation `/github/workflow/demo-pr`. Every store
    handle is read-only: `WorkflowStore.get_workflow_state`,
    `AgentExecutionStore.list_executions`,
    `AuditStore.get_audit_logs / list_audit_logs`,
    `IncidentStore.list_incidents`,
    `RedisStreamEventBus.client.xlen / xinfo_groups / xrevrange`.
  - Safe degradation: a failing data source returns its empty
    shape plus a `warnings: [...]` entry on the workflow view, or
    a `0` count on the summary view. The single exception is
    `/operations/workflows/{task_id}` which returns `404` when the
    workflow row itself doesn't exist.
  - No secret leakage: `github_has_token` is exposed as a boolean,
    never the value; `GITHUB_TOKEN` is read at request time and
    only its truthiness is recorded.

- **Unified workflow view result:**
  - `GET /operations/workflows/{task_id}` returns a JSON body with
    `task_id`, `workflow_id`, `stage`, `execution_status`,
    `approval_status`, `production_executed`, and twelve nested
    sections: `workflow`, `progress`, `agents` (agent_executions
    rows), `audit_timeline` (Step 18 unified audit rows),
    `incidents`, `deployment` (deployment_records row +
    decoded metadata), `github` (issue/branch/pr_url/checks/dry_run/
    status), `dlq` (per-task deadletter + terminal entries),
    `notifications` (per-task stream.notifications matches),
    `trace` (workflow trace_id), `safety`
    (production_executed + environment), plus
    `generated_at` and a `warnings` array for partial-data cases.
  - The view reuses `progress.build_progress` and
    `progress.build_audit_timeline` from Stage 18 so the agent and
    audit timelines are byte-identical to the existing
    `/workflow/timeline/{task_id}` output — no new schemas.
  - `github` falls back to `deployment_records.metadata.github`
    when `workflow_states.execution_result.github` is empty,
    covering the case where a workflow has not been re-loaded
    after the devops-agent wrote its deployment record.

- **Agent view result:**
  - `GET /operations/agents` lists all five pipeline agents
    (intake / requirement / development / qa / devops) with
    `name`, `health_url`, `health_status`, `status_url`,
    `processed_count`, `failed_count`, `last_task_id`,
    `last_error`, `input_stream`, `output_stream`,
    `consumer_group`, `recent_executions_count`,
    `recent_failures_count`.
  - `GET /operations/agents/{agent_name}` extends the overview
    row with `recent_executions` (the last 20 agent_executions
    rows), `recent_audit_events` (the last 20 audit_logs rows
    written by that agent), and `stream_info` (XINFO snapshot of
    the agent's input stream). Returns 404 for unknown agents.
  - The agent-level stream / consumer-group metadata is
    embedded in `PIPELINE_AGENTS` inside `operations.py` so the
    view is self-contained and does not import the agent
    packages.

- **Streams view result:**
  - `GET /operations/streams` enumerates 11 platform streams:
    `stream.tasks`, `stream.requirements`, `stream.development`,
    `stream.qa`, `stream.deployments`, `stream.devops`,
    `stream.approvals`, `stream.audit`, `stream.notifications`,
    `stream.deadletter`, `stream.deadletter.terminal`. Each row
    carries `length`, `groups` (one inner row per consumer
    group), `consumers`, `pending`, `lag`, `last_delivered_id`,
    `primary_group`, `status`.
  - Status derivation:
    * `pending > 0` → `warning`.
    * `lag > 0` with consumers >= 1 → `warning`.
    * `lag > 0` with consumers = 0 → `informational`.
    * The known Stage 19 gap on `stream.notifications` (no
      consumer yet) is explicitly relabelled
      `not_unified_by_design` so a dashboard doesn't flap on a
      documented design choice.
  - `stream.audit` should show `audit-group consumers >= 1` and
    `lag = 0` once the audit-worker is up. The streams view is
    the single source of truth for that check (runtime smoke
    `OPERATIONS_STREAMS_SMOKE` re-asserts it).

- **Safety view result:**
  - `GET /operations/safety` returns the three production
    counters (deployment_records production_executed=true,
    deployment_records environment=production,
    workflow_states production_executed=true) plus the GitHub
    mode booleans (`github_has_token`, `github_default_dry_run`,
    `real_github_test_enabled`), the Alertmanager receiver list
    (just names — no targets, no webhook URLs), and the
    governance notes (`vault_mode_note`, `postgres_auth_note`).
  - `result` field:
    * any production counter > 0 → `unsafe`.
    * counters clean + an external receiver (Slack / Discord /
      Telegram / PagerDuty / webhook) OR `GITHUB_TOKEN` present
      with `GITHUB_DRY_RUN=false` → `warning`.
    * counters clean + no warnings → `safe`.
  - No secret is ever returned. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is read at request
    time, reduced to a boolean, and never logged.

- **GitHub view result:**
  - `GET /operations/github/{task_id}` returns the github
    automation envelope from three sources fanned-in:
    `workflow_states.execution_result.github`,
    `deployment_records.metadata.github`, and the
    `github_pr_integration` + `github_automation` rows in
    `audit_logs`. `found = true` when any source contributes.
  - `source` is an array enumerating which of the three sources
    populated the response — operators can use it to detect
    drift (e.g. workflow_states says success but audit_logs
    has nothing).
  - On a workflow without GitHub data, returns `found = false`
    with empty fields rather than a 404 — this matches the
    operator workflow ("is there a PR for this task?").

- **DLQ view result:**
  - `GET /operations/dlq` returns the `stream.deadletter` +
    `stream.deadletter.terminal` snapshots (length + recent
    events). Filters: `task_id`, `stream`, `terminal=true`,
    `limit` (max 200).
  - The endpoint never ACKs, replays, or deletes anything —
    operator-driven replay still lives at
    `POST /deadletter/replay/{message_id}` on the
    retry-scheduler (Stage 16.x). Documented in the runbook.

- **Metrics / tracing result:**
  - New Prometheus series in
    `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py`:
    `operations_requests_total{endpoint,result}`,
    `operations_request_failures_total{endpoint,reason}`,
    `operations_request_duration_seconds{endpoint}`.
  - Decorator `_instrument(endpoint, span_name)` wraps every
    route, using `functools.wraps` so FastAPI keeps reading the
    underlying signature (otherwise path params would 422).
    Records elapsed time on every call, classifies the outcome
    as `ok` / `not_found` / `error`, and opens an
    `operations.<view>` span carrying `service.name`, `agent`,
    `endpoint`, `result`, plus `task_id` / `agent_name` when
    available.
  - The orchestrator container already scrapes
    `orchestrator:8000` in `infra/observability/prometheus.yml`
    — no scrape config change was needed (the new series
    auto-register on the existing target).

- **Production safety result:**
  - `verify_operations_view.sh` runs the production safety
    counters via `/operations/safety` and asserts both
    `production_executed_true_count = 0` and
    `workflow_production_executed_true_count = 0`. Stage 18
    already had them at `0`; Stage 20 does not write to any
    table, so the counters cannot regress as a result of this
    deliverable.

- **Modified / new files:**
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/operations.py` (new, ~600 lines)
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/main.py`
    (`app.include_router(operations_router)`)
  - `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py`
    (+3 `operations_*` series)

- **Test results (local Windows):**
  - `python -m pytest -q tests/`:
    297 passed, 115 skipped (+21 new operations cases on top of
    the 276/115 Stage 19 baseline). 100% of the new
    `test_operations_*` tests pass without docker — the
    operations module is exercised entirely through monkey-
    patched stores + httpx stubs.
  - `python -m ruff check .` → All checks passed.
  - `python -m black --check .` → 147 files would be left
    unchanged (after one auto-format pass on the new module +
    new tests).
  - `python -m mypy shared/` → Success: no issues found in 40
    source files.

- **Runtime verification (10.0.1.31, executed 2026-05-28):**
  - **Container state:** 20/20 services up + healthy after
    `docker compose up -d --force-recreate orchestrator`. The
    only container rebuilt was the orchestrator (operations.py
    is wired into its `main.py`); every other service was left
    untouched.
  - **`./scripts/run_tests.sh`:** `412 passed, 1 warning in
    44.73s`. ruff / black / mypy all green (`All checks
    passed`, `147 files would be left unchanged`, `Success: no
    issues found in 40 source files`). 391 -> 412 — +21 new
    operations cases land on the cluster the same way they do
    locally (no cluster-only skips on this scope).
  - **`./scripts/verify_operations_view.sh`:** `checks passed:
    10 / 10 — OPERATIONS_VIEW_VERIFY: PASS`. Every sub-check
    green; `/operations/safety` reports
    `production_executed_true_count=0`,
    `workflow_production_executed_true_count=0`, `result=safe`.
    `/operations/github/$gh_task` returns `found=true,
    dry_run=true, pr_url=https://..., source=audit_logs +
    workflow_states.execution_result.github`.
  - **`./scripts/verify_unified_audit.sh`:** `checks passed:
    9 / 9 — UNIFIED_AUDIT_VERIFY: PASS`. No regression — the
    audit-worker keeps doing its job; `stream.audit
    consumers=1 pending=0 lag=0`.
  - **`./scripts/verify_github_pipeline_flow.sh`:** `checks
    passed: 7 / 7 — GITHUB_PIPELINE_FLOW_VERIFY: PASS`
    (pr_url present, github_status=success, github_dry_run=true,
    production_executed=false, timeline carries
    github.demo_pr.dry_run, audit + notification + Tempo trace
    all green).
  - **`./scripts/verify_platform_observability.sh`:** `PASS=81
    FAIL=0 total=81`. All five sub-scripts pass.
  - **`./scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` operations + audit +
    github smokes:** all 9 new `OPERATIONS_*` smokes PASS; all
    8 Stage-19 `AUDIT_*` smokes still PASS; all 12 Stage-17/18
    `GITHUB_*` smokes still PASS — no regression anywhere.
  - **Production safety:**
    `deployment_records.production_executed=true OR
    environment=production` = `0`;
    `workflow_states.execution_result->>
    'production_executed'='true'` = `0`. Re-checked via the SQL
    counters AND via `/operations/safety`. Unchanged since
    Stage 18.
  - **Live `/operations/agents` snapshot:** all five agents
    `health_status=ok`. processed_count totals:
    `intake-agent=448`, `requirement-agent=448`,
    `development-agent=382`, `qa-agent=283`,
    `devops-agent=110`. recent_24h counts: intake=136,
    requirement=130, development=192, qa=112, devops=112.
  - **Live `/operations/streams` snapshot:** `stream.audit
    consumers=1 pending=0 lag=0 status=ok` (Stage 19 worker
    keeping up). `stream.notifications consumers=0 lag=7130
    status=not_unified_by_design` (known Stage 19 follow-up,
    documented label). `stream.deadletter consumers=1 lag=0
    status=ok`. Two pre-existing observations that the
    streams view surfaced for the first time (NOT caused by
    Stage 20):
    * `stream.tasks lag=942 status=warning` — consumers=1,
      pending=0; historical lag of unconsumed entries (looks
      like consumer-group `last-delivered-id` is behind the
      stream tail, likely from pre-Stage-17 runs).
    * `stream.approvals lag=815 status=warning` — same
      pattern (consumers=1, pending=0).
    * `stream.deadletter.terminal consumers=0 status=unknown`
      — the runtime XINFO GROUPS call returned an empty
      list. The group is created by `init_redis_streams.sh`
      so the most likely cause is that no terminal failure
      event has produced anything on the stream yet *in this
      Redis instance state* and Redis stopped tracking the
      group. Worth a separate look; not a regression caused
      by Stage 20 (the streams view is a new observer of an
      existing state).
  - **Live `/operations/safety`:** `result=safe`,
    `production_executed_true_count=0`,
    `workflow_production_executed_true_count=0`,
    `github_has_token=false`, `github_default_dry_run=true`,
    `real_github_test_enabled=false`,
    `alertmanager_receivers=["null-receiver"]`,
    `external_alert_receivers_present=false`. Tokens never
    appear in the response body.

- **Risks / observations only (not Step 20 roadmap decisions):**
  - **Operations API remains read-only.** This is the explicit
    Stage 20 contract; no `POST /operations/*` endpoint exists.
    Any future write surface (cancel / abort / replay shortcut)
    is a Step 20+ scope decision.
  - **Discord gateway not implemented.** Same as Stage 19.
    `/operations/safety` would surface `external_alert_receivers
    _present=true` the moment one is wired into Alertmanager.
  - **Notification consumer not implemented.** Same as Stage 19.
    `/operations/streams` labels `stream.notifications`
    `not_unified_by_design` so a dashboard doesn't flap on the
    known gap.
  - **Real GitHub write not executed.** Same as every prior
    stage: dry-run only. `/operations/github/{task_id}` shows
    the dry-run pr_url + `dry_run=true` envelope.
  - **Production hardening not completed.** Postgres trust auth,
    Vault dev mode, and Alertmanager null receiver all remain
    local/test-only. `/operations/safety` includes
    `vault_mode_note` and `postgres_auth_note` strings as
    explicit reminders so an operator reading the API output
    sees the same warning the runbook carries.
  - **Per-request `asyncpg.connect` cost.** Every
    `/operations/summary` call opens ~8 short-lived Postgres
    connections (one per count query). For a low-volume
    operator API this is fine; if `/operations/*` becomes a hot
    path it should move to a connection pool. The same pattern
    already lives in `audit-service` and the orchestrator
    workflow store — the load characteristics are identical.
  - **Stream snapshots are best-effort.** A Redis hiccup during
    `XINFO GROUPS` returns the empty group list rather than
    failing the endpoint. The runtime smoke
    `OPERATIONS_STREAMS_SMOKE` only requires the three known
    streams to be named in the response, so a transient
    `length=0` row doesn't flip the smoke to `CHECK`.


## Stage 21 — Step 20: Discord Gateway Sandbox Integration

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-29 09:00 – 12:00 (local)
- **Git branch / commit:** `main` -> Commit A
  `<Stage 21 discord-gateway sandbox + parser + ops proxy>`,
  Commit B (this entry) appended on top.
- **Previous commit:** `5d91a9a Stage 20: progress log - Step 19
  Operations Control API + 10.0.1.31 verification`.
- **Deployment target:** local/test runtime on 10.0.1.31 only. No
  real Slack / Telegram / PagerDuty / LLM / Kubernetes / cloud /
  Grafana Cloud / observability SaaS call. No real Discord API
  unless `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` AND `RUN_REAL_DISCORD_TEST=true` are
  both set — neither flag is set in the test cluster. No real
  GitHub write, no merge, no branch-protection change, no
  production deploy. Stage 21 only adds a new sandbox ingestion
  surface; no existing service contract changed.

- **discord-gateway result:**
  - New service `apps/discord-gateway/` (`Dockerfile`,
    `requirements.txt`, `src/parser.py`, `src/client.py`,
    `src/main.py`) listens on `127.0.0.1:8007`. Default
    `DISCORD_GATEWAY_MODE=sandbox`.
  - Endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /status`, `GET /metrics`,
    `POST /discord/messages`, `POST /discord/events/mock`,
    `GET /discord/messages`, `GET /discord/tasks/{task_id}`,
    `POST /discord/notify/test`,
    `POST /discord/real/test-message` (opt-in, 409 by default).
  - Tracing: `setup_tracing("discord-gateway")`,
    `instrument_fastapi`, `instrument_httpx`, `instrument_redis`.
    Custom spans: `discord.parse_message`,
    `discord.dispatch_task`, `discord.publish_notification`,
    `discord.write_audit`, `discord.operation_lookup`. Each span
    carries `task_id`, `discord.channel_id`, `discord.user_id`,
    `command_type`, `sandbox=true` attributes as appropriate.
  - FastAPI lifespan handler manages a running flag the
    `/status` endpoint surfaces (no `@app.on_event` — that path
    is deprecated). Lifespan uses the same `contextlib.async
    contextmanager` pattern as orchestrator / retry-scheduler.

- **Parser result:**
  - `parser.parse_discord_message` accepts all five command
    flavours (slash, natural, production, github-options-on,
    github-disabled). Output matches the existing
    `communication-gateway /intake/mock` payload:
    `{task_id, source: discord-sandbox, request: {type,
    description, github: {enabled, dry_run, repo,
    base_branch}, discord: {channel_id, user_id, message_id}},
    command_type}`.
  - Defaults: `type=dev.test`, `github.enabled=true`,
    `github.dry_run=true`, `github.repo=coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD`,
    `github.base_branch=main`. Auto-task-id when not supplied:
    `discord-<unix-ts>-<short-uuid>`.
  - Error contract: `ParseError -> 400` for empty messages,
    unsupported prefixes, and missing descriptions. The FastAPI
    route maps the exception to a safe HTTP 400 detail; the
    service never crashes on malformed input.

- **Sandbox intake result:**
  - The dev.test intake path drives the task through the
    existing `communication-gateway /intake/mock`
    orchestrator-mode call. No new dispatch path was added —
    the same Stage 15.5 pipeline handles intake / requirement /
    development / qa / devops. `publish_to_stream` is hard-coded
    to `false` so workflow_states gets created (and
    `/operations/workflows/{task_id}` can surface progress).
  - The intake response carries `task_id`, `stage`,
    `approval_required`, `operations_url`, `message`,
    `dry_run=true`, `sandbox=true`, `command_type`,
    `request_type`, `event_type`. `operations_url` always
    points at `/operations/workflows/{task_id}`.

- **Production approval result:**
  - `production.deploy` messages still go through the
    orchestrator approval gate. The intake response comes back
    with `stage=waiting_approval`,
    `approval_required=true`,
    `event_type=discord.task.waiting_approval`. No agent
    dispatch fires before approval; `production_executed`
    stays `false` because the orchestrator never reaches the
    devops-agent stage. The audit row carries
    `decision_type=discord_intake` with
    `result=waiting_approval` so an operator can filter by
    `agent=discord-gateway, result=waiting_approval` in
    `audit_logs`.

- **Audit / notification result:**
  - Audit: uses Stage 19 `shared/sdk/audit/publisher.publish_
    audit_event` to publish to `stream.audit`; audit-worker
    persists with `decision_type=discord_intake` (or
    `discord_notification_test`).
    `artifact_refs={channel_id, user_id, message_id,
    sandbox:true, operations_url}`. No direct HTTP call to
    audit-service — the gateway respects the Stage 19 unified
    path. Visible via
    `GET /audit/events?decision_type=discord_intake` and on
    `/workflow/timeline/{task_id}` /
    `/operations/workflows/{task_id}` `audit_timeline`.
  - Notifications: published directly onto
    `stream.notifications` via `NotificationClient.event_bus.
    publish_event` so the payload can include the
    Discord-specific `channel_id`/`user_id` fields the standard
    `send_notification` helper does not carry. Every event has
    `sandbox: true` and an `event_type` chosen from the
    documented vocabulary (`discord.task.received`,
    `discord.task.dispatched`, `discord.task.completed`,
    `discord.task.waiting_approval`,
    `discord.notification.test`). The metric
    `discord_notifications_published_total{event_type,
    sandbox}` records every publish.

- **Operations lookup result:**
  - `GET /discord/tasks/{task_id}` proxies
    `orchestrator /operations/workflows/{task_id}` (Stage 20)
    and reduces it to the operator-friendly fields a Discord UX
    cares about: `stage`, `execution_status`,
    `completed_agents`, `github.pr_url`, `github.dry_run`,
    `github.status`, `audit_timeline_count`,
    `incidents_count`, `production_executed`,
    `operations_url`. The full unified body is inlined under
    `operations_view` so an operator never has to make two
    round trips.
  - 404 from the underlying operations view passes through as
    a 404; 5xx from the orchestrator maps to a 502 detail.
    The proxy itself does NO mutation — it is the same
    read-only contract Stage 20 introduced.

- **Metrics / tracing result:**
  - New Prometheus counters / histogram:
    `discord_messages_received_total{command_type, sandbox}`,
    `discord_tasks_dispatched_total{command_type, result,
    sandbox}`,
    `discord_intake_failures_total{reason}` (reason in
    `parse_error|gateway_error|dispatch_error`),
    `discord_notifications_published_total{event_type,
    sandbox}`,
    `discord_request_duration_seconds{endpoint}`.
  - `infra/observability/prometheus.yml` adds the
    `discord-gateway:8007` scrape target.
  - Tracing spans listed under "discord-gateway result"
    above. The `discord.operation_lookup` span on
    `/discord/tasks/{task_id}` propagates `task_id` and
    `sandbox=true` so a Tempo TraceQL can follow the lookup
    into the orchestrator's `operations.workflow_view` span
    (Stage 20).

- **Optional real Discord test status:**
  - **NOT executed.** The cluster does not carry
    `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and `RUN_REAL_DISCORD_TEST` is unset,
    so `POST /discord/real/test-message` is hard-gated at 409.
    `client.DiscordClient.can_make_real_call()` returns
    `False`; the route returns a safe detail
    "real Discord test is not enabled - set
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN and RUN_REAL_DISCORD_TEST=true to opt in".
  - The token value is never logged, never echoed in a
    response body, never written to compose / README /
    progress.md / runbook. The token presence is only ever
    reduced to a boolean (`has_token`) on `/health` and
    `/status`.

- **Production safety result:**
  - Stage 21 introduces a NEW ingestion source but no new
    write path into deployment_records or workflow_states
    beyond what the orchestrator already does. The production
    counters cannot regress as a result of this deliverable:
    `deployment_records.production_executed=true OR
    environment=production = 0`;
    `workflow_states.execution_result->>
    'production_executed'='true' = 0`.

- **Modified / new files:**
  - `apps/discord-gateway/` (new, ~650 lines across
    `parser.py`, `client.py`, `main.py`,
    `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`)
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/operations.py` (+ discord-gateway
    in the services list shown by `/operations/summary`)
  - `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py` (+5 `discord_*`
    metrics)
  - `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`
    (+ discord-gateway on `127.0.0.1:8007`)
  - `infra/observability/prometheus.yml`
    (+ `discord-gateway:8007` scrape target)
  - `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`
    (+ 9 `DISCORD_*` runtime smokes)
  - `scripts/verify_discord_gateway.sh` (new, 12-check
    verify covering health, status, dev.test intake,
    operations lookup, audit_logs, notifications,
    production approval gate, and the real-Discord refusal)
  - `tests/test_discord_parser.py` (10 cases)
  - `tests/test_discord_gateway_service.py` (4 cases)
  - `tests/test_discord_intake_flow.py` (4 cases)
  - `tests/test_discord_production_approval.py` (1 case)
  - `tests/test_discord_audit_notification.py` (2 cases)
  - `tests/test_discord_operations_lookup.py` (2 cases)
  - `tests/test_discord_metrics_tracing.py` (3 cases)
  - `README.md`, `docs/operations/observability-runbook.md`,
    `docs/operations/manual-verification.md`,
    `source/progress.md` (this entry).

- **Test results (local Windows):**
  - `python -m pytest -q tests/`:
    323 passed, 115 skipped (+26 new discord cases on top of
    the 297/115 Stage 20 baseline). 100% of the new
    discord parser / service / intake / production-approval /
    audit-notification / operations-lookup / metrics tests
    pass without docker; the route logic is exercised
    entirely through monkey-patched httpx + audit/
    notification publishers.
  - `python -m ruff check .` -> All checks passed.
  - `python -m black --check .` -> All clean (after one
    auto-format pass on the new tests).
  - `python -m mypy shared/` -> Success: no issues found in
    40 source files.

- **Runtime verification (10.0.1.31, executed 2026-05-29):**
  - **Container state:** 21/21 services up. discord-gateway
    is healthy on `127.0.0.1:8007`; vault keeps its
    no-healthcheck design. The orchestrator was rebuilt to
    pick up the new entry in
    `/operations/summary.services_summary`; every other
    container was untouched.
  - **`./scripts/run_tests.sh`:** `438 passed, 1 warning in
    47.09s` after the doc-secrets fix. ruff / black / mypy
    all green (`All checks passed`, `157 files would be left
    unchanged`, `Success: no issues found in 40 source
    files`). 412 -> 438 — +26 new discord cases land on the
    cluster the same way they do locally (no cluster-only
    skips on this scope).
  - **Fix commit:** the manual-verification doc test
    `test_doc_does_not_embed_secrets` forbids the literal
    `token=` (case-insensitive) anywhere in the doc body.
    The first draft included `has_token=false` and a
    `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...` env-var assignment line that
    matched the guard. Reworded to "the `has_token` flag is
    `false`" and `export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in commit
    `e96c1bf Step 20 fix: manual-verification doc - avoid
    literal token= substring` — no semantic change to the
    verification instructions; doc test green and the
    cluster run repeated cleanly.
  - **`./scripts/verify_discord_gateway.sh`:** `checks
    passed: 12 / 12 — DISCORD_GATEWAY_VERIFY: PASS`. Every
    sub-check green: health (`mode=sandbox`,
    `has_token=false`), status (running + sandbox +
    `real_test_enabled=false`), dev.test intake accepted,
    `/discord/tasks/{task_id}` returned the unified view,
    `/operations/workflows/{task_id}` mirrored it with the
    full 12-section operations body, 5/5 pipeline agents in
    `completed_agents`, `github.dry_run=true` +
    `pr_url=https://github.com/coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD/
    pull/4523`, `audit_logs` carried
    `decision_type=discord_intake, agent=discord-gateway`,
    `stream.notifications` carried `discord.task.completed`,
    production.deploy correctly stopped at
    `stage=waiting_approval, approval_required=true,
    event_type=discord.task.waiting_approval` with
    `production_executed != true`, and
    `POST /discord/real/test-message` was refused with HTTP
    409.
  - **`./scripts/verify_operations_view.sh`:** `checks
    passed: 10 / 10 — OPERATIONS_VIEW_VERIFY: PASS` (Stage
    20 surface unchanged).
  - **`./scripts/verify_unified_audit.sh`:** `checks passed:
    9 / 9 — UNIFIED_AUDIT_VERIFY: PASS` (Stage 19
    audit-worker keeps doing its job; the Discord intake
    events are part of the new flow).
  - **`./scripts/verify_github_pipeline_flow.sh`:** `checks
    passed: 7 / 7 — GITHUB_PIPELINE_FLOW_VERIFY: PASS`
    (Stage 17/18 pipeline unchanged).
  - **`./scripts/verify_platform_observability.sh`:**
    `PASS=81 FAIL=0 total=81`. All sub-scripts green; no
    Stage 21 regression on tracing / SLO / alerting /
    incident lifecycle.
  - **`./scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`:** all 9 new
    `DISCORD_*` smokes PASS; all 9 Stage-20
    `OPERATIONS_*` smokes still PASS; all 8 Stage-19
    `AUDIT_*` smokes still PASS; all 12 Stage-17/18
    `GITHUB_*` smokes still PASS — no regression anywhere.
  - **Production safety:**
    `deployment_records.production_executed=true OR
    environment=production` = `0`;
    `workflow_states.execution_result->>
    'production_executed'='true'` = `0`. Re-checked via SQL
    counters AND via `/operations/safety`. Unchanged since
    Stage 18.
  - **Live discord-gateway metrics after the verify run:**
    `discord_messages_received_total{command_type="slash",
    sandbox="true"} = 8`,
    `discord_tasks_dispatched_total{result="ok",
    sandbox="true"} = 8`,
    `discord_notifications_published_total{
    event_type="discord.task.received",
    sandbox="true"} = 8`,
    `discord_notifications_published_total{
    event_type="discord.task.dispatched",
    sandbox="true"} = 5`,
    `discord_notifications_published_total{
    event_type="discord.task.waiting_approval",
    sandbox="true"} = 3`. Latency histogram on
    `/discord/messages` shows every observation
    `<= 0.25s` — comfortably below the 1s budget.
  - **Live audit_logs row for the production-deploy
    sandbox message:**
    `task_id=discord-prod-smoke-...,
    agent=discord-gateway,
    decision_type=discord_intake,
    result=waiting_approval`; artifact_refs include
    `channel_id=sandbox-prod, user_id=runtime-smoke,
    sandbox=true,
    operations_url=/operations/workflows/discord-prod-smoke-...,
    normalized_by=audit-worker,
    source_stream=stream.audit`. The Stage 19 unified audit
    path correctly persisted the Discord intake.
  - **Optional real Discord test:** **SKIPPED** by design.
    `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is unset on the cluster and
    `RUN_REAL_DISCORD_TEST` is not `true`;
    `POST /discord/real/test-message` returned 409 with the
    documented safety detail. No credential value was
    written anywhere; no Discord API call was made.

- **Risks / observations only (not Step 21 roadmap decisions):**
  - **Sandbox only.** `/health.mode=sandbox` and
    `/status.real_test_enabled=false` are the contract; the
    only real-Discord code path is opt-in and refused by
    default. The cluster verifies the refusal as part of
    `verify_discord_gateway.sh`.
  - **No real Discord API.** The opt-in pre-conditions are
    documented in README / runbook / manual-verification; this
    stage did not exercise them.
  - **No notification consumer.** Same Stage 19 follow-up
    note applies — Discord notifications publish to
    `stream.notifications` (which has no consumer yet) +
    are observable via the existing
    `communication-gateway /notifications` query. Stage 21
    did not change this gap. `/operations/streams` still
    labels the stream `not_unified_by_design`.
  - **No real GitHub write.** Default `github.dry_run=true`
    for every Discord-sourced task, including
    `production.deploy`. The safety contract for real GitHub
    writes is still owned by github-automation and the
    `RUN_REAL_GITHUB_TEST` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` pre-conditions
    documented in the github-automation runbook.
  - **Production hardening not completed.** Postgres trust
    auth, Vault dev mode, Alertmanager null receiver all
    remain local/test-only. `/operations/safety` and the
    runbook continue to flag this. Stage 21 added no new
    secret writer.
  - **In-memory recent-message buffer.** `/discord/messages`
    (GET) returns the last 200 messages observed by the
    process; this is sandbox-only state. A restart drops it.
    Acceptable for the operator UX this stage targets;
    documented in the service module docstring.


## Stage 22 — Step 21: Controlled Real Discord Validation & Notification Delivery Worker

- **Execution time:** 2026-05-29 13:00 – 17:00 (local)
- **Git branch / commit:** `main` -> Commit A
  `<Stage 22 notification-worker + controlled Discord + delivery records>`,
  Commit B (this entry) appended on top.
- **Previous commit:** `4e70899 Stage 21: progress log - Step 20
  Discord Gateway sandbox + 10.0.1.31 verification`.
- **Deployment target:** local/test runtime on 10.0.1.31 only. No
  real Slack / Telegram / PagerDuty / LLM / Kubernetes / cloud /
  Grafana Cloud / observability SaaS call. No real Discord API
  unless `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` + `DISCORD_TEST_CHANNEL_ID` +
  `RUN_REAL_DISCORD_TEST=true` are all set on the
  notification-worker container — none of them is set in the test
  cluster. No real GitHub write, no merge, no branch-protection
  change, no production deploy. Stage 22 only adds a controlled
  notification delivery surface; no existing service contract
  changed beyond the documented operations integration additions.

- **notification-worker result:**
  - New service `apps/notification-worker/` (`Dockerfile`,
    `requirements.txt`, `src/discord_client.py`, `src/worker.py`,
    `src/main.py`) listens on `127.0.0.1:8008`. Default
    `NOTIFICATION_WORKER_MODE=sandbox`; the env-derived mode label
    appears on `/health` and `/status`.
  - Endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /status`, `GET /summary`,
    `GET /metrics`, `GET /deliveries`,
    `POST /discord/real/test-message` (default 409).
  - Consumer: `XREADGROUP BLOCK` on `stream.notifications` using
    the existing `notification-group` consumer group (consumer
    name `notification-worker-1`). No busy polling. Idempotent
    `XGROUP CREATE` on startup.
  - ACK strategy: persist success -> XACK; transient delivery
    failure (real-mode only) -> no ACK, retry, deadletter onto
    `stream.deadletter` as `notification.deadlettered` after 3
    failed attempts. Normalize failures (non-dict payload, render
    error) skip + ACK so the group's pending list doesn't grow.

- **Sandbox delivery result:**
  - Default path turns every consumed event into a row in
    `notification_deliveries` (`status=simulated`,
    `sandbox=true`, `external_sent=false`, `channel=discord`,
    `target=sandbox-channel`). The rendered Discord message is
    stored under `metadata.rendered_message` so an operator can
    see exactly what would have been sent.
  - `render_discord_message` is intentionally explicit — it
    never dumps the full payload. The summary line carries
    `[event_type] task_id status=… production_executed=false
    ops=/operations/workflows/<task_id> [pr=… msg=…]`. A
    regression test (`test_render_discord_message_never_dumps_
    full_payload`) guards against accidental secret smuggling.

- **Real Discord guard result:**
  - `apps/notification-worker/src/discord_client.py`
    `NotificationDiscordClient` refuses any real call unless all
    three pre-conditions are met: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` non-empty,
    `DISCORD_TEST_CHANNEL_ID` non-empty,
    `RUN_REAL_DISCORD_TEST=true`. The client raises
    `DiscordDeliverySafetyError` otherwise; the FastAPI route
    maps it to HTTP 409 with a safe detail.
  - Even when enabled, the client targets `DISCORD_TEST_
    CHANNEL_ID` only and prefixes the body with
    `[AI-Agents-SWD sandbox]`. The token value travels only in
    the `Authorization` header; it never appears in any
    response, log, audit row, or migration.
  - Audit decision_types specific to the guard:
    `discord_real_test_skipped` (refusal),
    `discord_real_test_sent` (controlled-real send),
    `notification_delivery_failed` (Discord call raised).

- **notification_deliveries result:**
  - Migration `migrations/006_notification_delivery.sql` is
    idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` +
    `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`). It adds a single table
    `notification_deliveries` with the documented columns plus
    three indexes (`task_id`, `status`, `created_at DESC`) and a
    partial unique index on `source_message_id` so the
    `ON CONFLICT (source_message_id) DO NOTHING` dedup contract
    is enforced at the database level.
  - `shared/sdk/notifications/store.py`
    `NotificationDeliveryStore` exposes
    `create_delivery`, `get_delivery`, `list_deliveries`,
    `mark_delivered`, `mark_failed`, `counts`. Schema-only
    surface — no business logic. The dedup behaviour relies on
    the database constraint, not on an in-process cache, so a
    worker restart cannot create duplicates.

- **Audit result:**
  - Every consumed notification produces an audit event via the
    Stage 19 `publish_audit_event` publisher; the audit-worker
    persists it into `audit_logs`. Decision types:
    `notification_delivery` (sandbox simulation),
    `discord_real_test_sent` (controlled-real success),
    `notification_delivery_failed` (Discord call raised),
    `discord_real_test_skipped`
    (`/discord/real/test-message` refused).
  - Artifact_refs always carries `task_id`, `event_type`,
    `sandbox`, `external_sent`, `delivery_id`,
    `source_message_id` so the operator can correlate the audit
    row back to its `notification_deliveries` row + the original
    Redis envelope.

- **Operations integration result:**
  - `/operations/summary` gains
    `notification_delivery_summary` (total / simulated /
    delivered / external_sent / failed / skipped counts).
  - `/operations/workflows/{task_id}` gains a
    `notification_deliveries` section (count, latest_status,
    external_sent_count, simulated_count, failed_count,
    deliveries[]).
  - `/operations/safety` gains four Discord booleans
    (`discord_has_token`, `discord_test_channel_configured`,
    `discord_real_test_enabled`,
    `discord_external_send_enabled`). The token VALUE is never
    returned. `result` flips to `warning` when
    `discord_external_send_enabled=true` so an operator
    inspecting safety sees the live Discord credential
    immediately.
  - `discord-gateway` gains `GET /discord/deliveries` +
    `GET /discord/deliveries/{task_id}`. The existing
    `GET /discord/tasks/{task_id}` gains
    `notification_deliveries_count`, `latest_delivery_status`,
    `latest_delivery_message_id`, `external_sent`,
    `delivery_breakdown` so the Discord operator UX never has
    to make a second round trip to learn the delivery state.
  - `/operations/summary.services_summary` includes the new
    `notification-worker` container so the Stage 20 dashboard
    sees it.

- **Metrics / tracing result:**
  - New Prometheus counters / histogram (registered in
    `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py`):
    `notification_worker_processed_total{event_type}`,
    `notification_worker_delivered_total{event_type, channel}`,
    `notification_worker_simulated_total{event_type, channel}`,
    `notification_worker_failures_total{reason}`,
    `notification_worker_skipped_total{reason}`,
    `notification_worker_processing_seconds`.
  - `infra/observability/prometheus.yml` adds the
    `notification-worker:8008` scrape target.
  - Custom spans:
    `notification.consume` /
    `notification.render_discord_message` /
    `notification.simulate_delivery` /
    `notification.real_discord_send` /
    `notification.persist_delivery` /
    `notification.write_audit` /
    `notification.deadletter`. Each carries `task_id`,
    `event_type`, `channel`, `sandbox`, `external_sent`,
    `redis.message_id`, `stream=stream.notifications` as
    appropriate.

- **Production safety result:**
  - Stage 22 adds a new write path (`notification_deliveries`)
    but never touches `deployment_records` or
    `workflow_states`. The production counters cannot regress
    as a result of this deliverable.
    `deployment_records.production_executed=true OR
    environment=production = 0`;
    `workflow_states.execution_result->>
    'production_executed'='true' = 0`.

- **Modified / new files:**
  - `apps/notification-worker/` (new, ~750 lines across
    `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`,
    `src/discord_client.py`, `src/worker.py`, `src/main.py`)
  - `apps/discord-gateway/src/main.py` (+
    `/discord/deliveries` + `/discord/deliveries/{task_id}` +
    delivery-aware enrichments on
    `/discord/tasks/{task_id}`)
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/operations.py` (+
    `notification_delivery_summary`, +
    `notification_deliveries` section on the workflow view, +
    Discord safety booleans, + notification-worker in the
    services list)
  - `shared/sdk/notifications/store.py` (new)
  - `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py` (+6
    `notification_worker_*` series)
  - `migrations/006_notification_delivery.sql` (new)
  - `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml`
    (+ notification-worker on `127.0.0.1:8008`)
  - `infra/observability/prometheus.yml`
    (+ `notification-worker:8008` scrape target)
  - `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` (+ 9 `NOTIFICATION_*` /
    discord runtime smokes)
  - `scripts/verify_notification_delivery.sh` (new, 9-check
    verify covering health, status, delivery rows, audit,
    operations integration, real-Discord refusal, production
    safety)
  - `tests/test_notification_delivery_store.py` (7 cases)
  - `tests/test_notification_worker.py` (7 cases)
  - `tests/test_discord_delivery_policy.py` (4 cases)
  - `tests/test_discord_delivery_records.py` (5 cases)
  - `tests/test_notification_worker_metrics.py` (2 cases)
  - `tests/test_operations_notification_delivery.py` (4 cases)
  - `README.md`, `docs/operations/observability-runbook.md`,
    `docs/operations/manual-verification.md`,
    `source/progress.md` (this entry).

- **Test results (local Windows):**
  - `python -m pytest -q tests/`:
    `352 passed, 115 skipped` (+29 new notification cases on
    top of the 323/115 Stage 21 baseline). 100% of the new
    notification-worker / store / policy / records / metrics /
    operations-integration tests pass without docker.
  - `python -m ruff check .` -> All checks passed.
  - `python -m black --check .` -> 167 files would be left
    unchanged (after one auto-format pass on the new module +
    new tests).
  - `python -m mypy shared/` -> Success: no issues found in 41
    source files.

- **Runtime verification (10.0.1.31, executed 2026-05-29):**
  - **Container state:** 22/22 services up. notification-worker
    is healthy on `127.0.0.1:8008`; discord-gateway / orchestrator
    rebuilt + restarted to pick up the operations / discord-task
    enrichments. Vault keeps its no-healthcheck design.
  - **Migrations:** `006_notification_delivery.sql` applied
    cleanly (`BEGIN -> CREATE TABLE -> 4 CREATE INDEX -> COMMIT`)
    then re-applied with the unique-index fix (idempotent
    `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` + `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`).
  - **`./scripts/run_tests.sh`:** `467 passed, 1 warning in
    47.68s` after the two in-flight fixes. ruff / black / mypy
    all green (`All checks passed`, `167 files would be left
    unchanged`, `Success: no issues found in 41 source files`).
    438 -> 467 — +29 new notification cases land on the cluster
    the same way they do locally (no cluster-only skips on this
    scope).
  - **Fix commits during deployment:**
    1. `7df9f98 Step 21 fix: discord-gateway needs asyncpg +
       DATABASE_URL for NotificationDeliveryStore`. Stage 22
       wired `NotificationDeliveryStore` into discord-gateway
       so `/discord/deliveries` could query the new table, but
       the gateway's `requirements.txt` did not list `asyncpg`
       and the compose block did not pass `DATABASE_URL`. The
       container exited with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module
       named 'asyncpg'` on cluster startup. Fix: add asyncpg
       + opentelemetry-instrumentation-asyncpg, wire
       `instrument_asyncpg()`, add `DATABASE_URL` and
       `depends_on postgres` to the compose block. Same shape
       as every other Postgres-touching service.
    2. `a929473 Step 21 fix: notification_deliveries unique
       index - drop partial WHERE clause`. Original migration
       used a partial unique index
       (`WHERE source_message_id IS NOT NULL`); Postgres
       refused the SDK's `ON CONFLICT (source_message_id) DO
       NOTHING` with "no unique or exclusion constraint
       matching the ON CONFLICT specification". 273 worker
       INSERTs failed and retried before the migration was
       patched. Fix: drop the partial variant, recreate as a
       plain unique index; NULL values remain distinct in a
       regular unique index so operator-driven deliveries
       without a `source_message_id` still coexist. Cluster
       re-apply is one idempotent migration run; subsequent
       INSERTs succeeded immediately.
  - **`./scripts/verify_notification_delivery.sh`:** `checks
    passed: 9 / 9 — NOTIFICATION_DELIVERY_VERIFY: PASS`. Every
    sub-check green: `/health` returns
    `mode=sandbox, has_discord_token=false`, `/status` shows
    `running=true, group=notification-worker-group,
    input_stream=stream.notifications`, the dev.test sandbox
    intake produced 10 `notification_deliveries` rows (event
    types: `discord.task.received`,
    `discord.task.dispatched`, `discord.task.completed`,
    `workflow.completed`, plus the per-stage agent
    completions). Every row has `sandbox=true,
    external_sent=false`. `audit_logs` carries
    `decision_type=notification_delivery,
    agent=notification-worker` rows with the documented
    artifact_refs.
    `/operations/workflows/{task_id}` surfaces the
    `notification_deliveries` section with the breakdown.
    `POST /discord/real/test-message` refused with HTTP 409 +
    the documented safety detail; production safety counters
    both `0`.
  - **`./scripts/verify_discord_gateway.sh`:** `checks
    passed: 12 / 12 — DISCORD_GATEWAY_VERIFY: PASS` (Stage 21
    surface unchanged after the asyncpg fix).
  - **`./scripts/verify_operations_view.sh`:** `checks
    passed: 10 / 10 — OPERATIONS_VIEW_VERIFY: PASS`.
  - **`./scripts/verify_unified_audit.sh`:** `checks passed:
    9 / 9 — UNIFIED_AUDIT_VERIFY: PASS` (the audit-worker
    keeps capturing every new
    `decision_type=notification_delivery /
    discord_real_test_skipped` row).
  - **`./scripts/verify_github_pipeline_flow.sh`:** `checks
    passed: 7 / 7 — GITHUB_PIPELINE_FLOW_VERIFY: PASS`.
  - **`./scripts/verify_platform_observability.sh`:**
    `PASS=81 FAIL=0 total=81`. All sub-scripts green.
  - **`./scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`:** all 9 new
    `NOTIFICATION_*` / discord-delivery smokes PASS; all 9
    Stage-21 `DISCORD_*` smokes still PASS; all 9
    Stage-20 `OPERATIONS_*` smokes still PASS; all 8
    Stage-19 `AUDIT_*` smokes still PASS; all 12
    Stage-17/18 `GITHUB_*` smokes still PASS.
  - **Production safety:**
    `deployment_records.production_executed=true OR
    environment=production` = `0`;
    `workflow_states.execution_result->>
    'production_executed'='true'` = `0`. Re-checked via SQL
    counters AND via `/operations/safety`. Unchanged since
    Stage 18.
  - **Live `/operations/safety` after the verify run:**
    `result=safe`,
    `discord_has_token=false`,
    `discord_test_channel_configured=false`,
    `discord_real_test_enabled=false`,
    `discord_external_send_enabled=false`. None of the four
    Discord opt-in env vars is set in the cluster.
  - **Live notification-worker metrics:**
    `notification_worker_processed_total` totals (sample):
    `workflow.dispatched=38`, `discord.task.received=11`,
    `agent.intake_completed=44`, `requirement.completed=44`,
    `development.completed=37`, `qa.completed=37`,
    `github.pr.dry_run=76`, `workflow.completed=35`,
    `workflow.waiting_approval=13`,
    `discord.task.waiting_approval=3`, `workflow.failed=7`,
    `incident.acknowledged=4`, `incident.resolved=4`,
    `workflow.resumed=4`, `discord.task.dispatched=8`.
    `notification_worker_failures_total=0`,
    `notification_worker_skipped_total{reason="duplicate"}`
    visible whenever the worker replays the residual pending
    list — same Stage-19 audit-worker pattern.
  - **Optional real Discord test:** **SKIPPED** by design.
    `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` / `DISCORD_TEST_CHANNEL_ID` /
    `RUN_REAL_DISCORD_TEST` are unset on the cluster. Route
    returned HTTP 409 + the documented safety detail; one
    `decision_type=discord_real_test_skipped` audit row was
    written per refusal so the contract is observable in
    `audit_logs`.

- **Risks / observations only (not Step 22 roadmap decisions):**
  - **Sandbox only by default.** `/health.mode=sandbox` and
    `/status.external_send_enabled=false` are the contract.
    The controlled-real path is opt-in and refused by default;
    the cluster verifies the refusal as part of
    `verify_notification_delivery.sh` and the runtime smoke
    `DISCORD_REAL_TEST_GUARD_SMOKE`.
  - **Real Discord test skipped.** Cluster doesn't carry
    `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`; `RUN_REAL_DISCORD_TEST` is unset;
    `DISCORD_TEST_CHANNEL_ID` is unset. The
    `/discord/real/test-message` route returns 409 with the
    documented safety detail and writes one
    `discord_real_test_skipped` audit row so the contract is
    observable.
  - **No real GitHub write.** Stage 22 did not add any new
    GitHub code path. The pipeline-level safety contract
    (Stage 17 dry-run default) is unchanged.
  - **Production hardening not completed.** Postgres trust
    auth, Vault dev mode, Alertmanager null receiver remain
    local/test-only. Stage 22 added no new secret writer
    beyond the opt-in Discord bot credential (which lives
    only in the env var, never in code / migrations / docs /
    audit / responses).
  - **Notification backlog policy.** The worker uses the
    existing `notification-group` (created with `$` at
    Stage 15.5) so it drains every event the group hasn't
    delivered on first startup — same behaviour Stage 19's
    audit-worker demonstrated. The
    `source_message_id` partial unique index protects against
    duplicates on any future replay (`XGROUP SETID`).
  - **Sandbox `rendered_message` storage.** The summary line
    written under `metadata.rendered_message` is bounded to
    short, explicit fields (event_type, task_id, status,
    operations_url, optional pr_url + message). The test
    `test_render_discord_message_never_dumps_full_payload`
    guards against any future producer accidentally
    smuggling a secret into the rendered string.

## Stage 23 — Step 22: Controlled Real GitHub Validation

- **Execution window:** 2026-05-29 (UTC+8 working day) —
  authored locally on `main`, deployed to 10.0.1.31, verified.
- **Branch / commits (push order):**
  - Local + cluster deliverable: `9dd368c` (Step 22
    controlled real GitHub validation + safety guard + audit/
    notification/operations wiring)
  - Stage 23 progress log: this commit
- **Repo:** https://github.com/coolerh250-AI-Agents-SWD.git
  (workspace path on test server: `/home/itadmin/AI-Agents-SWD`).
- **Modified / added files (Stage 23 deliverable):**
  - `apps/github-automation/src/main.py` — `POST /github/workflow/
    real-test-pr` endpoint + `RealTestPRRequest` + `build_real_test
    _pr_body` + safe audit/notification publishers (no token in any
    response). `/health` gains `real_github_test_enabled` +
    `test_repo_configured` booleans (no token value).
  - `apps/github-automation/src/real_guard.py` (new) — pure
    `evaluate_real_test_request(...)` returning a `GuardResult`. Pins
    branch prefix (`ai-agents-test/`), title prefix
    (`[AI-Agents-SWD Test]`), file scope
    (`docs/github-real-test/`), file-content markers
    (`task_id` / `workflow_id` / `generated_by=github-automation` /
    `real_github_test=true` / `production_executed=false`), PR-body
    sections (six sections including the new mandatory
    `## Safety Notes`), repo equality with `GITHUB_TEST_REPO`,
    and forbidden base branches (`production` / `prod` /
    `release/*`). `dry_run` must be exactly `False` (the
    pydantic default `None` is treated as not-opt-in).
  - `shared/sdk/observability/metrics.py` — five new
    `github_real_test_*` series:
    `github_real_test_attempts_total{repo,result}`,
    `github_real_test_success_total{repo,result}`,
    `github_real_test_blocked_total{repo,reason}`,
    `github_real_test_failures_total{repo,reason}`,
    `github_real_test_duration_seconds{repo,result}`.
  - `apps/orchestrator/src/operations.py` — module-level
    `REAL_TEST_DECISION_TYPES` constant; new
    `_summarise_real_test_events(...)` helper; `/operations/safety`
    gains `github_test_repo_configured` +
    `github_external_write_enabled` booleans + a
    `github_external_write_enabled` warning (verdict downgrades
    from `safe` → `warning`); `/operations/github/{task_id}`
    surfaces a `real_test` section with
    `safety_guard_result.{latest_success,latest_blocked,latest
    _failed}`; `/operations/workflows/{task_id}.github.real_test`
    carries the same trio for the unified workflow view.
  - `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` — pass-through
    `RUN_REAL_GITHUB_TEST` + `GITHUB_TEST_REPO` env vars on both
    `github-automation` and `orchestrator` (default `false` / empty).
  - `tests/conftest.py` — preload `real_guard` under its canonical
    module name so `apps/github-automation/src/main.py` can
    `from real_guard import` when loaded via `spec_from_file_location`.
  - `tests/test_github_real_guard.py` (new, 18 cases) — guard
    matrix, including parametrised
    forbidden-base-branch and dry_run-not-explicit-false checks.
  - `tests/test_github_real_workflow_endpoint.py` (new, 13 cases) —
    every failure mode returns HTTP 409 with structured
    `safety_guard_result`; full-flow happy-path test stubs
    `GitHubClient` so no real API call leaves the process; token
    leak check asserts the response body never contains the env
    token value.
  - `tests/test_github_real_pr_template.py` (new, 7 cases) — pins
    the six required PR sections (including `## Safety Notes`), the
    required file markers, and the three allowed prefixes
    (branch / title / file path).
  - `tests/test_github_real_operations.py` (new, 4 cases) — asserts
    `/operations/safety` carries the four `github_*` booleans
    without leaking the token, and `/operations/github/{task_id}`
    surfaces both blocked and success real-test events.
  - `tests/test_github_real_metrics.py` (new, 2 cases) — asserts
    every Stage 23 series is registered on the default
    Prometheus registry and that one blocked request labels the
    `github_real_test_blocked_total` counter.
  - `scripts/verify_real_github_validation.sh` (new, 12 checks) —
    default mode asserts `REAL_GITHUB_TEST_SKIPPED: PASS` + HTTP
    409 with no token leak + audit row + operations view + dry-run
    regression + production safety. Optional opt-in path (all three
    env vars set) additionally asserts PR / issue / branch URLs,
    `github.real_test_pr.created` notification, audit row,
    `/operations/github/{task_id}.real_test.latest_success`.
  - `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` — five new Stage 23 smokes:
    `GITHUB_REAL_GUARD_SMOKE`, `GITHUB_REAL_TEST_SKIPPED_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_REAL_METRICS_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_REAL_OPERATIONS_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_DRY_RUN_REGRESSION_SMOKE`.
  - `docs/operations/manual-verification.md` — new section 17b
    (Controlled real GitHub validation), Stage 23 sign-off items
    (three new bullets).
  - `docs/operations/github-automation-runbook.md` — new section
    13 (Stage 23 controlled real GitHub validation procedure).
  - `README.md` — new top-level section "Controlled Real GitHub
    Validation (Stage 23)" covering required env, sandbox repo
    requirement, allowed actions, forbidden actions, safety guard,
    how to verify SKIPPED mode, how to run the controlled real
    test, how to inspect `/operations/github/{task_id}`.
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31`, repo path
  `/home/itadmin/AI-Agents-SWD`, container topology unchanged
  (22 services). Only `github-automation` and `orchestrator` were
  rebuilt + force-recreated; the observability quartet
  (`prometheus` / `grafana` / `alertmanager` / `tempo`) was
  force-recreated to pick up the same scrape topology.
- **Test results (local + cluster, no real GitHub API call):**
  - **Local quality gates (pre-push):** `pytest -q` 65 focused
    Stage-23 + regression cases PASS; the slower full sweep
    (`./scripts/run_tests.sh`) on the cluster shows
    **511 passed, 0 failed, 115 skipped**.
  - **Cluster runtime smokes (`./scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`):**
    every prior smoke PASS, plus the five new Stage 23 smokes
    PASS: `GITHUB_REAL_GUARD_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_REAL_TEST_SKIPPED_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_REAL_METRICS_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_REAL_OPERATIONS_SMOKE`,
    `GITHUB_DRY_RUN_REGRESSION_SMOKE`.
  - **`./scripts/verify_real_github_validation.sh`** —
    `checks passed: 12 / 12` ⇒
    `REAL_GITHUB_VALIDATION_VERIFY: PASS` with
    `REAL_GITHUB_TEST_SKIPPED: PASS`. The script verified
    `/health.real_github_test_enabled=false`,
    `/operations/safety.github_*` four booleans all `false`,
    `/github/workflow/real-test-pr` returning HTTP 409 +
    `safety_guard_result.allowed=false`, no token leak in the
    refused response, audit row
    `decision_type=github_real_test_blocked`,
    `/operations/github/{task_id}.real_test.latest_blocked`,
    `/github/workflow/demo-pr` dry-run regression PASS,
    `deployment_records.production_executed=true` and
    `workflow_states.production_executed=true` counts both `0`.
  - **`./scripts/verify_github_automation.sh`** — 7/7 PASS
    (Stage 17 dry-run flow unchanged; "OPTIONAL: real GitHub test
    SKIPPED" as expected).
  - **`./scripts/verify_github_pipeline_flow.sh`** — 7/7 PASS
    (`tempo.trace.github-automation: PASS`; pipeline integration
    unchanged).
  - **`./scripts/verify_discord_gateway.sh`** — 12/12 PASS.
  - **`./scripts/verify_notification_delivery.sh`** — 9/9 PASS.
  - **`./scripts/verify_operations_view.sh`** — 10/10 PASS.
  - **`./scripts/verify_unified_audit.sh`** — 9/9 PASS.
  - **`./scripts/verify_platform_observability.sh`** —
    `PASS=81  FAIL=0` ⇒ `PLATFORM_OBSERVABILITY_VERIFY: PASS`.
  - **Production safety SQL** — both queries return `0`:
    `deployment_records` with
    `metadata->>'production_executed'='true'` or
    `environment='production'` is `0`; `workflow_states` with
    `execution_result->>'production_executed'='true'` is `0`.
  - **Manual `curl` verification** of section 11 — HTTP 409 with
    `safety_guard_result.{allowed:false, reason:missing_github_
    token, repo:coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD, details:{}}` and the
    word `token` does not appear in any response body other than
    the structured guard field names (no token value present).
  - **Quality gates:** local `ruff check .` clean, `black --check`
    clean, `mypy shared/` clean (41 source files).
- **Container roster (10.0.1.31, post-deploy):** 22 services all
  `running (healthy)` (`postgres`, `redis`, `vault`, `orchestrator`,
  `policy-engine`, `approval-engine`, `audit-service`,
  `communication-gateway`, `intake-agent`, `requirement-agent`,
  `development-agent`, `qa-agent`, `devops-agent`,
  `github-automation`, `retry-scheduler`, `audit-worker`,
  `discord-gateway`, `notification-worker`, `prometheus`,
  `grafana`, `alertmanager`, `tempo`).
- **Risks / observations only (not Step 23 roadmap decisions):**
  - **Sandbox-only by default.** `/health.real_github_test_enabled
    =false`, `/health.test_repo_configured=false`, and
    `/operations/safety.github_external_write_enabled=false` are
    the contract. The controlled-real path is opt-in and refused by
    default; the cluster verifies the refusal as part of
    `verify_real_github_validation.sh` and
    `check_runtime_state.sh` (`GITHUB_REAL_GUARD_SMOKE`).
  - **Real GitHub test skipped.** Cluster doesn't carry
    `GITHUB_TOKEN`; `RUN_REAL_GITHUB_TEST` is unset;
    `GITHUB_TEST_REPO` is unset. The `/github/workflow/real-test-pr`
    route returns 409 with the documented `safety_guard_result`
    body. One `decision_type=github_real_test_blocked` audit row
    was written per refusal so the contract is observable.
    `production_executed_true_count=0` everywhere.
  - **Sandbox repo pinning.** When the optional opt-in path is
    enabled, the guard's `repo == GITHUB_TEST_REPO` check makes it
    impossible to redirect a real PR to an unintended repository by
    tampering with the request body. The cluster default leaves
    `GITHUB_TEST_REPO` empty so the route refuses with reason
    `missing_github_token` (token is the first check) — the repo-
    mismatch path is exercised by the unit tests instead.
  - **No merge, no branch protection change.** The endpoint walks
    `issue → branch → file → PR → checks` and stops. There is no
    code path that calls `PATCH /repos/:owner/:repo/branches/:branch
    /protection`, no path that POSTs to `/merge`, no path that
    `DELETE /repos/:owner/:repo/git/refs/heads/:branch`. Cleanup
    is the operator's manual responsibility (close PR, delete
    branch, revoke PAT).
  - **No production deploy.** The Stage 23 flow targets a sandbox
    repo and writes one file under `docs/github-real-test/`. No
    `deployment_records` row is created. The platform's
    `production_executed=false` counters stay at `0`.
  - **Token handling.** `GITHUB_TOKEN`, when set, is read at call
    time by `GitHubClient._headers()` only — every other layer
    (operations view, audit, notification, metrics, spans, /health,
    /safety) reduces it to a boolean. The endpoint's safe-error
    path returns the structured `safety_guard_result` without any
    token-shaped substring; the test
    `test_response_never_contains_token` and the verify script's
    token-leak greps guard against any future regression.
  - **`audit_logs` shape.** Stage 23 introduces three new
    `decision_type` values (`github_real_test`,
    `github_real_test_blocked`, `github_real_test_failed`). They
    are persisted by the existing Stage 19 unified
    `stream.audit → audit-worker → audit_logs` path —
    no new persistence code path was added.
  - **In-flight fixes.** None. Stage 23 was deployed cleanly in
    one push (deliverable `9dd368c`); the Stage-22 in-flight
    asyncpg and unique-index fixes did not recur.
  - **Production hardening not completed.** Postgres trust auth,
    Vault dev mode, Alertmanager null receiver remain
    local/test-only. Stage 23 added no new secret writer beyond
    the opt-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (which lives only in the env var,
    never in code / migrations / docs / audit / responses).
  - **Notification backlog policy.** Unchanged from Stage 22.
    The Stage 23 endpoint publishes one
    `github.real_test_pr.created` event per controlled-real
    success; the existing `notification-worker` consumes it and
    writes one `status=delivered, sandbox=true, external_sent=true`
    delivery row when a real Discord channel is configured (the
    cluster default does not have one, so a sandbox `simulated`
    row is written instead).

## Stage 24 — Step 23: Staging Runtime Hardening & Secrets Baseline

- **Execution window:** 2026-05-29 (UTC+8 working day) — authored
  locally on `main`, deployed to 10.0.1.31, verified.
- **Branch / commits (push order):**
  - Deliverable: `fe82c52` (Step 23 staging runtime hardening
    baseline — Stage 24).
  - Stage 24 progress log: this commit.
- **Repo:** https://github.com/coolerh250/AI-Agents-SWD.git
  (workspace path on test server: `/home/itadmin/AI-Agents-SWD`).
- **Modified / added files (Stage 24 deliverable):**
  - `infra/runtime/env.schema.example` (new) — canonical env
    template with placeholder-only secrets.
  - `infra/runtime/env.staging.example` (new) — staging-flavoured
    template; pins `APP_ENV=staging`, removes trust-auth tolerance.
  - `infra/runtime/runtime-config.schema.json` (new) — per-mode
    rule table the validator reads.
  - `infra/runtime/README.md` (new) — local vs staging diff + the
    do-not-commit list.
  - `infra/docker-compose/docker-compose.staging.yml` (new) — staging
    template (template, not replacement). Postgres uses
    `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` via env substitution + drops
    `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust` + separate
    `postgres-staging-data` volume + no Vault dev-mode container.
  - `shared/sdk/secrets/__init__.py`, `models.py`, `provider.py`
    (new) — `SecretProvider` abstraction with env / vault-placeholder
    backends; `SecretRef` that redacts itself in repr / str /
    `model_dump`; `redact` / `redact_mapping` helpers.
  - `apps/discord-gateway/src/client.py` — token now lives in
    `_token_ref: SecretRef`; the `Authorization` header reads the
    value via `_token_ref.reveal()`. `has_token` is still a bool.
  - `apps/notification-worker/src/discord_client.py` — same SecretRef
    wrap for the controlled-real Discord delivery client.
  - `apps/github-automation/src/main.py` — `/health.has_token`
    reads through `default_provider().has_secret("GITHUB_TOKEN")` so
    a placeholder value reports as "not present".
  - `scripts/validate_runtime_config.py` + `.sh` (new) — three
    modes (`local` / `staging` / `production-check`). Findings
    never include secret values.
  - `scripts/backup_postgres.sh` (new) — `pg_dump --format=custom`
    to `backups/aiagents-<ts>.dump`.
  - `scripts/restore_postgres.sh` (new) — refuses unless
    `ALLOW_RESTORE=true` AND backup file argument supplied AND
    `APP_ENV` is not `production` / `production-check`.
  - `scripts/verify_backup_restore.sh` (new) — fresh `pg_dump` +
    `pg_restore -l` TOC parse + table-count-unchanged + restore
    refusal smoke. Ends `BACKUP_RESTORE_VERIFY: PASS`.
  - `scripts/production_safety_gate.sh` (new) — read-only gate.
    Inspects `deployment_records` / `workflow_states` /
    `/operations/safety` / Alertmanager receivers / Vault note /
    Postgres note. Exits 0 on PASS, 1 on FAIL.
  - `scripts/runtime_health_snapshot.sh` (new) — writes
    `source/runtime-health.log` (gitignored) with the platform
    health summary. No token-shaped substring.
  - `scripts/verify_staging_hardening.sh` (new) — aggregate
    verifier with 9 checks.
  - `scripts/check_runtime_state.sh` — 6 new Stage 24 smokes
    (`RUNTIME_CONFIG_LOCAL_SMOKE`,
    `PRODUCTION_SAFETY_GATE_SMOKE`,
    `BACKUP_RESTORE_SMOKE`,
    `RUNTIME_HEALTH_SNAPSHOT_SMOKE`,
    `SECRET_REDACTION_SMOKE`,
    `STAGING_TEMPLATE_SMOKE`).
  - `tests/conftest.py` — preload `validate_runtime_config` under
    the canonical module name so the Python 3.14 dataclass
    re-registration race doesn't bite the validator tests.
  - `tests/test_runtime_config_validator.py` (new, 14 cases).
  - `tests/test_secret_provider.py` (new, 13 cases).
  - `tests/test_staging_compose_template.py` (new, 8 cases).
  - `tests/test_backup_restore_scripts.py` (new, 10 cases).
  - `tests/test_production_safety_gate.py` (new, 7 cases).
  - `tests/test_runtime_health_snapshot.py` (new, 6 cases).
  - `docs/operations/staging-runtime-hardening.md` (new) — operator
    runbook.
  - `docs/operations/manual-verification.md` — new section 17c +
    five sign-off checklist items.
  - `README.md` — new "Staging Runtime Hardening (Stage 24)"
    section.
  - `.gitignore` — adds `backups/`, `*.dump`, `*.sql.gz`; unignores
    `shared/sdk/secrets/*.py` (the broader `secrets/` pattern was
    catching the new SDK dir).
- **Deployment target:** test server `10.0.1.31`, repo path
  `/home/itadmin/AI-Agents-SWD`, container topology unchanged
  (22 services). Only `github-automation`, `discord-gateway`,
  `notification-worker` rebuilt + force-recreated; the observability
  quartet (`prometheus` / `grafana` / `alertmanager` / `tempo`) was
  force-recreated to pick up the same scrape topology.
- **Test results (local + cluster, no real GitHub / Discord call):**
  - **Local quality gates (pre-push):** ruff clean, black clean,
    mypy clean (44 source files), full pytest sweep
    **456 passed / 0 failed / 115 skipped** in 593s.
  - **Cluster `./scripts/run_tests.sh`:** **571 passed, 1 warning**
    (the `test_github_tracing_metrics.py` deprecation warning is
    pre-existing). All optional linters clean.
  - **Cluster `./scripts/check_runtime_state.sh`:** every prior
    smoke PASS, plus 6 new Stage 24 smokes PASS:
    `RUNTIME_CONFIG_LOCAL_SMOKE`,
    `PRODUCTION_SAFETY_GATE_SMOKE`,
    `BACKUP_RESTORE_SMOKE`,
    `RUNTIME_HEALTH_SNAPSHOT_SMOKE`,
    `SECRET_REDACTION_SMOKE`,
    `STAGING_TEMPLATE_SMOKE`.
  - **`./scripts/verify_staging_hardening.sh`** —
    `checks passed: 9 / 9` ⇒ `STAGING_HARDENING_VERIFY: PASS`.
    Detail:
    - `RUNTIME_CONFIG_VALIDATION: PASS`
    - `PRODUCTION_SAFETY_GATE: PASS`
    - `BACKUP_RESTORE_VERIFY: PASS` (backup file size = 1,515,861
      bytes; 9 tables before == 9 tables after; restore refusal
      observed)
    - `RUNTIME_HEALTH_SNAPSHOT_DONE: PASS` (log size = 6,570 bytes)
    - `HEALTH_LOG_NO_TOKEN: PASS`
    - `STAGING_TEMPLATE_NO_TRUST_AUTH: PASS`
    - `ENV_EXAMPLES_PLACEHOLDER_ONLY: PASS`
    - `PRODUCTION_EXECUTED_FALSE: PASS`
    - `SECRET_REDACTION: PASS`
  - **`./scripts/verify_real_github_validation.sh`** — 12/12 PASS,
    `REAL_GITHUB_TEST_SKIPPED: PASS`.
  - **`./scripts/verify_notification_delivery.sh`** — 9/9 PASS.
  - **`./scripts/verify_discord_gateway.sh`** — 12/12 PASS.
  - **`./scripts/verify_operations_view.sh`** — 10/10 PASS.
  - **`./scripts/verify_unified_audit.sh`** — 9/9 PASS.
  - **`./scripts/verify_github_pipeline_flow.sh`** — 7/7 PASS
    (`tempo.trace.github-automation: PASS`).
  - **`./scripts/verify_platform_observability.sh`** —
    `PASS=81  FAIL=0` ⇒ `PLATFORM_OBSERVABILITY_VERIFY: PASS`.
  - **Production safety SQL** — both queries return `0`.
  - **Extra Stage 24 validation:**
    `./scripts/validate_runtime_config.sh --mode local` ⇒
    `RUNTIME_CONFIG_VALIDATION: PASS`;
    `./scripts/production_safety_gate.sh` ⇒
    `PRODUCTION_SAFETY_GATE: PASS`;
    `./scripts/runtime_health_snapshot.sh` ⇒ written to
    `source/runtime-health.log` (6,570 bytes, no token-shaped
    substring); the snapshot's head shows `git HEAD = fe82c52` and
    all 22 services `running (healthy)`.
- **Container roster (10.0.1.31, post-deploy):** 22 services all
  `running (healthy)` — `postgres`, `redis`, `vault`,
  `orchestrator`, `policy-engine`, `approval-engine`,
  `audit-service`, `communication-gateway`, `intake-agent`,
  `requirement-agent`, `development-agent`, `qa-agent`,
  `devops-agent`, `github-automation`, `retry-scheduler`,
  `audit-worker`, `discord-gateway`, `notification-worker`,
  `prometheus`, `grafana`, `alertmanager`, `tempo`.
- **Risks / observations only (not Step 24 roadmap decisions):**
  - **Still local/test.** The local cluster on `10.0.1.31` keeps
    `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust`, Vault `server -dev`, and
    the Alertmanager `null-receiver`. Stage 24 is strictly
    additive — it documents the gap and ships the tools an
    operator would use to close it, without changing the running
    cluster's posture.
  - **Vault dev mode.** Unchanged. The validator's `staging` mode
    rejects this unless `ALLOW_VAULT_DEV_MODE_FOR_STAGING=true`
    is set as an explicit escape hatch.
  - **Postgres trust auth.** Unchanged on `docker-compose.yml`.
    `docker-compose.staging.yml` demonstrates the staging swap.
  - **Alertmanager null receiver.** Unchanged.
  - **Backup limitations.** The Stage 24 backup script targets the
    local cluster's trust-auth path. For staging an operator
    supplies `PGPASSWORD` in the shell that runs the script. The
    backup file is binary `pg_dump -Fc`; archives are not
    encrypted at rest by the script itself (gitignored under
    `backups/`).
  - **Production readiness gap.** Stage 24 does not produce
    a production-ready platform. The validator's
    `production-check` mode is an audit gate that a future stage
    could run against a real Vault + real Postgres + real
    Alertmanager. Nothing in this stage authorises a production
    deploy.
  - **Other:**
    - SecretRef wrap: the Stage 24 SDK shim does not change the
      observable behaviour of `/health` / `/operations/safety`
      (`has_token` remains a bool); only the internal storage on
      the Discord client instances changed from `str` to
      `SecretRef`. The unit suite asserts the redaction contract;
      the existing Discord delivery tests still pass.
    - `source/runtime-health.log` is regeneratable and gitignored
      (covered by the existing `*.log` rule). The Stage 24 verify
      script greps the file for token-shaped substrings as a
      regression guard.
    - The .gitignore negation for `shared/sdk/secrets/*.py` is
      narrow — it does NOT re-enable `__pycache__/` inside that
      directory (the build-artifact pyc files stay ignored).
    - Following Stage 22 / Stage 23, Claude Code does not decide
      the Step 24 roadmap.
